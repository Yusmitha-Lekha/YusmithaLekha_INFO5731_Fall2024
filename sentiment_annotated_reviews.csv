1,"This is what Hollywood needs. A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.",positive
2,"I'm going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I'll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I'll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn't especially impressed with Timoth√©e Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn't bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don't know if I'd call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they're still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn't important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It's a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won't be realized for several generations. That's a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could've been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I'll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you're just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it's more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that ""nothing happened"" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It's easy to understand why people who haven't read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what's happening before it's moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul's first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul's mentat training isn't brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica's character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she's almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she's almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn't in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn't make sense for her to do that, even though she's pregnant.Speaking of Jessica's child, Alia isn't really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don't really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn't read the book could probably use.Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn't show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there's no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other's needs so well that they don't even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don't believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn't really present, and Chani definitely isn't part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it's fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don't like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul's actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.I'm running out of room to write, and most people probably won't read this anyway because of the length, so I'll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they're good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.",positive
3,"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.""Dune: Part 2"" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the modern era.Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.Timoth√©e Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In ""Part 2,"" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in ""Dune: Messiah"", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",positive
4,"Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.""Power over spice is power over all""- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was ""game of thrones in space"", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind ""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi."" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timoth√©e Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the ""water of life"" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.",positive
5,"As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer.",positive
6,"If you liked or loved the first one, the same will apply for this one. Personally, I loved this one even more and I think general audiences will as well. So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.",positive
7,"It was a visual spectacle and refreshingly it lived up to and beyond the hype.However, for me there was a niggling itch through the movie. Something about Chani's character that bothered me and only grew as the movie progressed.I googled to see if others shared this feeling, all I could find was praise for the character. However there was consensus that she was written very different from the book.I finally found an article that helped describe the disconnect I felt with ChaniThe following is not my writing and all credit is given to Kara Kennedy - "" ...Herbert's novel Dune, Chani has a range of roles and avenues of strength, influence, and power. She becomes Paul's love but begins as the young woman who introduces him to a foreign desert land in his visions and the one who guides him as he integrates into the Fremen community. She is a fierce young fighter as well as a religious leader in her role as Sayyadina, standing apart from Paul to oversee the cultural rites. She is a young mother who finally wins the approval of her child's Bene Gesserit grandmother, Jessica, and saves Paul from a long coma. She is wise enough to understand the political necessities of Paul legally marrying a princess and trusted by him to negotiate the marriage contract.Chani's attachment to Paul is an important part of the story, but it does not reduce her to being a simple, one-dimensional female character. Chani is an essential window into Fremen culture. Her multi-faceted character challenges stereotypes about women of faith and women in non-Western cultures that continue to be debated about in the real world.Meanwhile, the films-Dune: Part One and especially Dune: Part Two-make substantial changes to Chani's character in the name of making her more independent, which end up making her more stereotypically masculine. She is mainly a fighter who has a fling with Paul. She is not a mother and not a religious figure, instead rejecting any association with religious beliefs or practices. She is almost a second Jamis except that she has a brief romantic entanglement with Paul.Chani's disavowal of the religious elements in her culture arguably represents a contemporary, Western, cynical view taking over the story; that religion must be purged to empower the individual, to free women from their shackles. This change in Chani's character appears to be intended to make her more free and complex, because she's not a follower and she doesn't believe. She can be dismissive of Paul and sees little to learn from him. Their relationship is then not a mutual exchange, a partnership, but something she has to turn aside from to be independent.The underlying message is that if Chani were a woman of faith like in the book, she couldn't be an interesting, complex character, just a follower who's oppressed. The takeaway is that the Fremen's religious system is bad because it was influenced by outsiders. That faith makes people weak and that being a fighter and killer is preferable to being like the women who live in the sietches, wear headscarves, and discuss religious ideas, or who carry the tribe's ancestors in their bodies.Chani may also reflect a deeper fear in the increasingly secular West about the power of religion in the 21st century. It is possible that the idea in Dune of an oppressed group militarily united under a religious banner, drawing strength from a belief in something greater than themselves, is still too much to put on screen in an adaptation, especially given the book's Middle Eastern influences. If viewers need to be reassured that not everyone believes, that there is division, that someone is the rational one to turn away from the 'fundamentalists,' then Chani offers this. She is the contrasting perspective, the voice of so-called reason, who questions the religious indoctrination.But ultimately, the considerable changes made to Chani's character for Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations alienate her from her lover and her culture and strip her of the many roles she has in the book. Any complexity gained by her skepticism is offset by the loss of her influence and authority and her place in her community. Chani's depiction in the films worryingly suggests that the price of being an independent woman means being faithless and alone.""",positive

It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!!This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever!I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved!Now I am gonna watch this movie again, and maybe again! Then I am gonna read the books!",positive
9,"A monumental piece of cinema.Paced to perfection, uniquely beautiful, thought-provoking, beyond thrilling, with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding. Backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since Fellowship of the Ring. An entire production on their A-Game.. it's an incredible technical achievement. Everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special. Denis Villeneuve's love for 'Dune' shines through every stunning frame. Part 1 of his adaptation was wonderful, but here he improves on it in every way. It just doesn't get better than this.",positive
10,"I have to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first movie. I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment...
Let's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public..
For once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it..
The movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate...
The relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie...
An A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and L√©a Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again.",positive
11,"This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.",positive
12,"Dune Part 2 is an epic movie; slickly made, and visually stunning.But I had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book, especially the water of life scene and the final battle.The movie had almost a 3 hour run time, but it felt overlong because Villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substance.It is a beautiful movie, but it feels like it has no soul. The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling
The Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.",positive
13,"The Bad1. The dialogue is clunky and robotic with too much name use (shoutout to the live script-reading from the princess).2. The constant exposition dumps are spoon fed to you as to ensure you can digest the baby food (unlike the first).3. Illogical fights: attack the mining structure and lose men to launch a bazooka at the thopter and only then use your energy beam weapon that instantly destroys the giant structures? And when they beat the emperor why didn't the bene gesserits use the voice on Paul or the fremen? Why did the emperor get to choose a champion to fight Paul after all he'd done? How the hell are the fremen (at the exact same time) able to mount like 4 worms at the exact same time and use the worms to attack the harkonnens while we never see a single dismount.4. 100% pointless scenes: ""you wanna be a fremen, walk from here to there and back."" Never shows him complete the task, never shows him being accepted as a fremen BECAUSE he accomplished it.This movie plays like a super long episode of a poorly written tv series that's trying to cram as much from the book as possible onto the screen (again, completely unlike the first).",negative
14,"I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, rarely seen in modern day cinema.",positive
15,"As an avid movie fan I see plenty of movies, many average, many bad, a few good and once in while great. But I use the word great scarcely. Dune 2 is better than great. Oppenheimer was a great movie but I wouldn't rush back to see it a second time in the near future. Dune 2, I would see it again tomorrow. The story is on par to the Star Wars legacy, the acting, on par with Oppenheimer, the SFX better than the two movies just mentioned combined. When the movie finished (over 2 and half hours) I still wanted more. The emotional ride was like nothing I can remember from ANY movie I can remember. Best movie of the year? I don't think so, best movie of a generation is more akin to what I saw. Wish I could give it 11 stars.",positive
16,"Visually and musically stunning like the first movie with excellent action scenes. Casting superb for the most part. Aside from Walken as Emperor, which in my opinion was not a great cast. Nothing against Christopher as an actor, but he just doesn't seem all that well in that roll, but still good enough to get the job done. Also, I am not the biggest fan of Zendaya. Visually she's a good cast for Chani, but her constant angry face and little chemistry with Paul is distracting. Chalamet and Ferguson absolutely nailed the roles.My main issues with the movie are incomplete or reduxed storytelling and that the director decided not to include possiblly some of the most important and fascinating elements and scenes, at least for me, from the story.The werding way. I was disappointed, since the technology was available, that the directoror did not incorporate the (Bene Gesserit) werding way martial art of Paul and Jessica, where the moments were so fast that it almost appeared as teleportation. This should have been in the movie, to emphasize how incredibly skilled, mysterious and god-like Paul and Jessica would be to the fremen (and the viewer).Jessica's reverend mother transformation was not explained properly and seriously underperformed by the writing. The explanation of the magnitude and significance of what Reverend Mother is was not construed properly in the movie. Reverend mothers were seriously overpowered beings with strong powers and influence. The fact that there was another hidden reverend mother on Dune was not signified properly. The transformation in the book was much more poignant and there was very little explanation to Jessica's daughter Aliah, and the Abomination. Jessica's role was seriously deminished in the second movie.Kwisatz Haderach, I found the significance and explaition and the powers were inadequately explained and explored by the movie. As mentioned earlier, the significance of powers of Reverend Mothers. But it wasn't shown how much of a big deal the Kwisatz Haderach actually was and how much more powerful he was. His precience, past memories should have been more visually and nuanced.It felt like the director was too cautious or afraid to explore the more mysterious and transcedental parts of the story, which in my opinion are the core of the story. Without it feels almost pointless and like a different plot, where Paul just fights to free the Fremen and Jessica gets a nun spiritual job with the Fremen. While Paul is shown as a gifted fighter with some sort of special abilities, that don't look all that different to anyone else. Where in fact Paul's fighting when using weirding way would almost be incompreheble to the Fremen.In summary, the movie is a visual feast with a theatrical presence of a masterpiece, but fails capture the magnitude of the main characters and their abilities and in essence what the power struggle (not just for spice) is all about. Could have been a 10/10.",positive
17,"We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor . The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD.",positive
18,"""Dune"" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve.",positive
19,"Saw an early screening of this film at the Tilton Square Theatre in New Jersey, and I was completely blown away. From the opening scene all the way until the credits I never felt bored, which is impressive for a 2 hour and 45 minute film.I don't want to write too much here, I prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately. It doesn't release worldwide until March 1st, so grab tickets and I would highly recommended you see it in IMAX if possible. Almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with IMAX cameras.This movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple Oscar's for sound editing, picture, etc., and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically. Like I stated in the beginning, see this film!",positive
20,"Like the first part, the second part is visually stunning, though having read the book twice, I regret to say that unlike the David Lynch version from the eighties, De Villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mystical/mythical core of the story. This makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied. In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.Having left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience. A kind of secular, profane Dune. Still nice, but also a bit disappointing.",negative
21,"I just watched this in IMAX and it was one of the greatest movie experiences I have ever had. Everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting. The outfits were so unique and really well made. Whenever I thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and I'm instantly drawn back into the world of dune that Denis has remade and expanded on so much. All the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking. The last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good. The last fight was awesome as well. ""You fought well Atreides.""",positive
22,"The biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into Hollywood over the last decade and no-one seems to really acknowledge... the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then he/she really is but in reality they are boring and wooden. Not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling. Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.It's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not.",positive
23,"As a sci-fi enthusiast, I approached the latest Dune 2 movie with a sense of anticipation, hoping to be swept away by its grandeur and depth. However, what I encountered left me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected. The film seemed to lack the spark that ignites the imagination, opting instead for a plodding pace that failed to engage me fully.Perhaps it was my own weariness or a misalignment with the source material, but I struggled to find moments worth revisiting after the credits rolled. The supposed ""best scenes"" seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony, leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling to.While I can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life, I can't help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted. Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.In the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression.",positive
24,"This movie is a visual masterpiece that will be studied for decades. The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should. I believe that film should stand on its own two feet, and this one does. Its legs are long and slender, with just the bare minimum of muscle required to stand, but it stands nonethelss :)",neutral
25,"In the quiet embrace of ink and page, a story unfolded, timeless and sage, through the lens of a filmmaker's artistry, its essence soared, a masterpiece for all to see, i think Denis Villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie that's ever been made, the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last 20 years, there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art, it's what Infinity War and Endgame looks like if it's not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie, the more adult version of Star Wars, Dune has just become the most intriguing, fascinating, and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now, Marvel universe are over, Star Wars universe are over, let the maestro Denis Villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one, i'm glad to be able to say that i think Dune: Part Two was a Masterpiece, i haven't felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time, i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect, i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was, how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was, and how amazing all of the performance was, props to Timoth√©e Chalamet, i'm not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the Oscars next year, he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered, each dialogue was great, each scene from one to another felt important and worth it, action scenes are some of the best i've seen in a while, and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done, 2 hours and 47 minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine, and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration, it's that good, it's that epic, it's that great, Mastering others is strength, mastering yourself is true power, overall i could see both Denis Villeneuve Dune finally get the influential recognition 10 years from now, and specifically Part Two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made, Dune: Part Two was easily the best films of the year so far, it is more than what he supposed to deliver.",positive
26,"Dune: Part Two is simply Denis Villeneuve's Magnum Opus in his filmography. I've loved this director's work since ""Blade Runner 2049"", and ""Arrival"". He did an excellent job placing his vision on the first Dune, but here, Villeneuve cranks his direction times 10!The structure, set-up, visuals, sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words, due to how everything came together so miraculously. The acting is also top-notch! Timoth√©e Chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal, and Zendaya does a great job as well. Austin Butler, Rebecca Ferguson and Florence Pugh are also excellent! Denis never lets you out of this experience! The pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives, rich cinematography, an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screen!There are quite a handful of thrilling moments that I still have no idea how they came out THIS good in the end! Denis Villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the Sci-Fi genre! Every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell, and it's no different here in the slightest!Dune: Part Two made me leave the theater feeling inspired! There's so much to take away from this masterpiece! Definitely my #1 favorite movie of this year as of now! Bring on Dune: Part Three as fast as possible!",positive
27,"This movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out, absolutely mesmerizing experience. I loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it, but Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising sci-fi director of this age. I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields. Rebecca Ferguson, Timoth√©e Chalamet, Javier Bardem, Austin Butler and Zendaya give wonderful performances, with the first three being standouts. Overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didn't even enjoy the first installment of the series.",positive
28,"I did enjoy the movie, but I saying it's as good as Dark Knight will be a huge overstatement.Enough good things have already been said about this movie, so I'll just point out the negatives:1. All viallians feel quite weak, bland, and never seem to pose any real threat. Bautista's character is a joke, Baron isn't threatening, and the new villian (being called as good as joker by some people) also feels very generic. The *new abilities* that Paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get.2. Characters change a lot instantly, Jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character, and same goes with Paul.3. I can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format, but the pacing could've been better.4. Paul is the prophesied prophet, and... That just happens with no surprises etc. In some ways, I think that was for the better, as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche, but I was prepared to feel tense for Paul, but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tense.Overall, it's a solid 8/10, it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc., but as a movie overall, it's just another 'good watch' which is well worth its time, and that's completely fine.",positive
29,"The movie picks up right where the first film left off, and while I personally go CRAZY over the direction of this film, it comes with its share of challenges.The tops
Visuals. Denis Villeneuve's vision of Arrakis is absolutely beautiful and something you would want to look at. The desert landscapes and the intricate details of the Fremen's world are portrayed with such precision and care. Every frame is so certain in its story.Timoth√©e as Paul Atreides, wow. Brought nuanced performance that captures Paul's every situation, struggle with perfection.Finally, Zendaya gets more screen time as Chani (as she should). The chemistry that she and Timothee had on screen added a much-needed emotional layer to the film. The relationship felt authentic and grounded, providing a human touch amidst the grandiose setting.The Flaws
The pacing is a significant issue. At times, the movie feels like it's dragging, especially during some of the longer, more introspective scenes. These moments, while beautiful, can feel a bit too drawn out and risk losing the audience's attention. It's a film that demands patience, and not everyone will appreciate this slow-burn approach. The plot itself remains dense and complex, staying true to the novel. For fans of the book, it's a joy to see such a faithful adaptation. However, for those who aren't familiar with the source material, the story can be confusing and hard to follow. There are many characters, political factions, and subplots to keep track of, and the film doesn't always make it easy to understand what's going on. A bit more exposition or simplification could have gone a long way in making the film more accessible to a broader audience.Another area where the film falls short is in its emotional resonance. While the performances are strong, there's a certain coldness to the story. The epic scope and the focus on political intrigue sometimes overshadow the personal, human elements. I found myself appreciating the film intellectually more than emotionally. It's a grand, impressive spectacle, but it doesn't always connect on a deeper, more personal level. The action scenes, when they come, are thrilling and well-executed. The battles are intense, and the use of practical effects combined with CGI creates a believable and immersive experience. The Sandworms, iconic to the Dune universe, are particularly well done, evoking both awe and terror. Hans Zimmer's score deserves a special mention. His music elevates the film to another level, adding a haunting, otherworldly quality that perfectly matches the tone and scale of the story. It's powerful and evocative, enhancing the impact of the visual storytelling.In conclusion, DUNE PART 2, is a visually stunning and ambitious film that stays true to its source material. It offers strong performances, particularly from Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya, and creates an immersive world that is a joy to get lost in. However, its slow pacing, complex plot, and emotional detachment can make it a challenging watch. Fans of the first film and the book will likely appreciate it, but it may not resonate as strongly with a broader audience. It's a film that demands patience and attention, rewarding those who are willing to dive deep into its intricate world, but potentially alienating those looking for a more straightforward or emotionally engaging experience.",neutral
30,"This movie has the same problems as part one. The editing in this is terrible! Scenes don't connect, they start an assignment or story branch, then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests. No idea is complete, nothing gets resolved, and the dialogue is horrendous.These movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow. If you haven't read the books you won't understand anything that's happening here. What we have here is a movie that is really pretty. It maxes out in the visuals category. The sound was hit or miss, but the plot, pacing and characters were all bad.Not a masterpiece. Sorry.",negative
31,"After watching the advanced screening, we were blown away by Part 2 of Dune. It continues seamlessly after Part 1, with the same masterful soundtracks, action scenes and acting.The movie flew by despite it being almost three hours. The pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slow.The CGI was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors. The chemistry between the characters felt so real - nothing felt fake or forced.It's truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything - flawless screenplay, writing, sound, acting and pacing, but Dune 2 does it all.One of the best movies of 2024 for sure.",positive
32,"From the time this movie has been released it has been described as one of the best sequal ever made,but I feel bad to say this; it's not.It is still a good movie but it is inferior to the first part.I haven't read the books and when i watched the first part it was so entertaining and when you know a director like Denis Villeneuev will also make the next part,your expectations increases multiple times.I can understand they have a book and they are making it according to the source material but still you don't feel that amazement or thrill like the first movie.For me the biggest reason is not hiring the writer of the first movie Eric Roth.He is a damn good writer and has written movies like Forrest gump,The curious case of Benjamin button and etc.I don't know the reason why he wasn't there for this movie. But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.They changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.It goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.I am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.Behaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.You know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.But as we know it would never come out.Rest acting,music, cinematography all are good like the first part.You will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from it.Let's hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this one.I believe in Denis Villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make.",positive
33,"So look, Dune Part 1 by Denis Vilneuve was pretty decent. I'd give that one a 7ish. But part 2 was really pretty boring and lacked all of the gravitas you had in the first movie.Everyone in the movie is incredibly serious and every word they speak is extended by long close ups of their faces. It's really drab... And in the end I really didn't care about any of the characters. It was just scene after scene of people saying really serious stuff that ultimately is not believable or particularly deep.The music is faux epic and sadly doesn't lend any particular weight to what's ultimately a decent story told in a very boring way.I'd say the VFX is good - yeah... not bad. But the costumes and the battle scenes are also boring - like going through the motions.The film has a few good moments, but an epic sci-fi masterpiece of our time this film is not. The silly desert walks are pretty funny though! XD haha.",positive
34,"If this movie wasn't 3 hours long... if it were say, 2 hours, I'd probably give it a solid 8. A lot went into this film. And I could write a review full of things I liked. But given all the 10 of 10 ratings (making it possibly the most overrated Hollywood film this century) I just have to state the minuses.Dune: part 2 was full of long dialogue heavy scenes and too many characters and too much ""worship"" of Timoth√©e Chalamet's character Paul. We get it.. he's the ""chosen one."" It just came off as clich√©. And Zendaya is cool, but she's not the caliber of actor that can hold a movie for 3 hours. She had RBF the entire movie.Also the build up to the bad guys dying over the last two films was a big let down. The ""uncle"" character (Baron) was awful for 2 films and he gets killed in 2 seconds. Same with his ""nephew"" (Glossu). All this time spent with them and they just fall over and die. And Christopher Walken was terribly miscast in this as the emperor. Weak character.And the sandworms. They were cool the first 5 times. But for the amount of screen time they get and they never change... it gets old after awhile.It's a good film to revisit to fall asleep too. But it other than a cool soundtrack and some great cinematography and costume design, this film doesn't really do much. Dune has proven a very difficult story to capture on film and no one has done it right yet.",positive
35,"Here I'll conflate both of Villeneuve's Dunes within one critic: It is a slow, wide, deep and bare opus, best viewed on the biggest possible screen and sound system, in typical Villeneuve fashion.I didn't read the books but I saw the 1984 movie, and Villeneuve's version is built to become a classic, even if less spectacular or outrageous. What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.Alas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.On the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence. In fact nearly all actors were very good, up to par with the technical team. Those movies get better with every viewing. A solid 8 stars.",positive
36,"Paul has to prove himself to both Chani and The Fremen, his dreams become more vivid, one path leads to destruction, maybe even the loss of Chani.I don't think I've anticipated a film quite so much as this, since being spellbound by the first, I counted down the days for this follow up, and by chance got to see it a day early.In one single word, captivating, the best film I've seen in a very long time, absolutely wonderful from start to finish, the character development, visuals, music, action sequences are all tremendous.We get to see Paul growing before our very eyes, the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start, the best yet from Chalamet, he shows a degree of grit.A special mention about the performance of Austin Butler, I thought he was incredibly good as Feyd Rauth, what a menacing villain, one of those that had you wondering about what he'd do next, and that makeup, awesome.I can't fault a single performance, inspired casting, backed up by a marvellous script.The music is spot on once again, I instantly wanted to download Ripples in The sand and Paul's Dream once again.Incredible visuals, from the amazing location work, to the creative camera work, and the jaw dropping special effects.I thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise, as so much happens at the start and the finish, it wasn't the case, this was a fabulous movie.10/10.",positive
37,"I couldn't see Christopher Walken as embodying a character in this. I only saw Christopher Walken as Christopher Walken.And I might be the only person on Earth who finds Florence Pugh to be the epitome and definition of BLAND. They could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play Irulan.Also the movie feels like an episode more than the conclusion of a two-part movie. I can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the Dune novels. So if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you, that is the best explanation I can give to you in your time of cinematic need.Otherwise, the film is entertaining for its length. Lots of good cinematography, music, etc.",positive
38,"Movie is so good that I went back to theater next day for watch it again. I have never done this before, I have never watched any movie twice in theater.I just couldn't get enough of this film and it feels like I need to go watch it 3rd time. Visuals and sounds are stunning, cast is so good that I can't ask any better performance. The whole dune universe is magical, intriguing, captivating and thrilling. If you are fan of science fictions and good lore with deep detailed story behind it. This movie is a love letter for you.Absolutely AMAZING film!! This is my all time number 1 movie I have ever seen in my 40 years old age on this planet.",positive
39,"Frank Herbert's Dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen. In 2021, Villeneuve hit it out of the park with Dune - Part One. In Part Two, he outdoes himself in every way. From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike. There is so much to love here that I can't imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entry.See this on the biggest screen you can find. Then see it again. The visuals and score demand it. You will not be disappointed.",positive
40,"I had the joy of watching this movie early, and was nothing short of amazed. Simply put this movie is one of the best crafted, and most impressive films I have ever seen. The casting is spectacular, and the massive character arcs that are displayed masterfully are as well. The camera angles are creative and unique, showcasing multiple landscapes in fascinating new ways (even surpassing the quality of Dune part One). This movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three Star Wars movies in a way. Both franchises paved the way for something entirely new, and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come. This movie was one of the best I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to sit through a three hour long movie.",positive
41,"I mean, yeah, it's very entertaining and, of course, very visually stunning. The set pieces, the cinematography, the use of visual effects and lights, the sound design and music, all, absolutely amazing and almost literally stunning!But then? I'm not really seeing much after that. As I have not read the books, this movie was a total mystery to me. There's barely any dialog--at least not any that would explain anything what's going on at all. The world and the technology etc just doesn't make much sense to me.None of the characters are particularly interesting, to be honest. They don't really have that much personality to them, and even if they did, they didn't really make me care about them all that much.I don't know, I'm a bit conflicted, it wasn't a bad movie and, as I said, it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing, but it lacked the depth that I was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history. Maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books? As someone to who the world is not familiar at all, it just seems rather confusing and strange. I feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can (in which they arguably succeeded), but left the story on the pages of the books.",positive
42,"I just watched the pre-premiere of part two of Dune. It was a very good adaption of the books but not what totally what I expected. At the end the movie strayed away from the book which made me a bit sad to be honest. Especially the part (which is very important in the book-storyline) is the fact that the sister of Paul wasn't born yet when the film came to it's conclusion. Where in the book his little sister kills the Baron in the film Paul takes the honor of doing so. Also the fact that Chani is not supporting Paul for taking the hand of the Emperor's daughter, didn't have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come. As a movie it was a great experience though. The action is great and the storytelling just as well. I personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end. Part one definitely did follow the book... part two also till the midst of the film. Still I strongly recommend to watch it... it is a must-see movie and ranks as one of my alltime favorites already.",positive
43,"I haven't seen the first Chalamet Dune, but I have seen the David Lynch one and personally think it's so much better. I think the cinematography was beautiful in DPT, the acting was great, the accuracy to the books... but I was so bored. It makes me wonder what the goal of making these movies (besides money, duh) was; a modern interpretation of Dune? A deep dive into the character dynamics? A story that would be better appreciated with improved CGI? Beats me.My opinion might be controversial, but despite being a well-made movie, I just don't think it's that remarkable. Lynch's Dune was bizarre, had that beloved retro sci-fi vibe, WAY more memorable character designs, and just left more of an impression on me. Accuracy between books and their movies is also a divisive topic, but unless the author is making the movie themself, why expect perfect duplication?My recommendation: unless you're a die-hard Dune fan, you can definitely skip this one.",positive
44,"Both films are pretty consistent in the sense of, they both look amazing. The sound and score is top tier (Hans Zimmer). The action sequences ARE good when they actually happen (which is not very often.) The actors are all good actors. But they're both just straight up boring films to the core.I don't understand how people write reviews calling it 'masterpiece' or 'the peak of film making.' I just don't believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up DEAD story and DEAD dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie. The only piece of dialogue I actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when Timothy Chalamet said to Josh Brolin 'I recognise your footsteps.' I'm not missing anything, I'm sure. It was just...nothing. I couldn't wait for it to end.It just seems to me people are lying because they want to 'seem' smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past. Or they're just Timothy Chalamet groupies (I'm a big fan of him as an actor in his other work) and just want him to do well. I refuse to believe anyone found the plot of this movie good (thus making it entertaining) and it's not like it made up for the lack of story with amazing story telling through action like Mad Max Fury Road did. Can anyone think of any other reasons why people would really rate this movie even close to a 10/10?",positive
45,"It is probably impossible to create a good Dune movie, as the book(s) are really complex in many ways. With that said, the first movie captured the essence of Dune as well as you could and kept true to the plot for the most part.This second movie, however, kills some characters and dynamics. Why is Stilgar only a comedic relief? Why did they decide to leave Alia, one of the most important characters in the books, out of the movie? Why is the relationship between Chani and Paul so shallow? They even left out that they had a son that died. The ending scene is underwhelming and is not in line with Paul from the books.If you're willing to ignore these issues, or you have never read the books at all, this is still a GREAT movie, but the authentic Dune experience still remains Frank Herbert's book.",positive
46,"Great movies should always leave you with a feeling during or after seeing them.While this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece by many, I felt that it didn't give me the feeling of chills that Dune part 1 made feel multiple times.Those who say that it is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made should be arrested at once.This movie had all the ingredients to actually be a modern day masterpiece but it feels like Dennis was a bit restraint to go all the way, as if he could not dare to be free and do things he could have done with the story and action.That being said, Dune part 2 is an amazing movie and I will see it again.However. While I've seen the part 1 more than 6 times, I don't think part 2 will have that effect on me.Time will tell.",positive
47,"Before you call Dune Part II 'the best Sci-fi movie' or even just a 'masterpiece' try and consider the 5 bullet points I've made below - you might even end up agreeing with some of them ;)Beforhand let me just point out that the movie was extraordinary beautifully filmed with goosebumpy music added to a dozen of memorable shots, hence the good rating. So yeah, it is a great movie with great acting. It's actually a really good movie. But that has been pointed out by a LOT of people already. Let me tell why this isn't in the 10/10 league.1. The major problem: Pacing. 2 parts of the movie, which could have been legendary, ended up being rushed: The battle of the Sardaukar and Fremen and Paul's first time riding the Worm-metro.You don't have to be a criticizer of the movie to admit, that the last fight with Fremen and Sardaukar was so shy of what it could have been. The fremen just sweeps away the emperor's army (I mean come on) in around 10 minutes of screentime. This is what the whole movie leads up to. 10 minutes. And not 10 nail-bittering minutes with an epic battle. Just 10 minutes of one side slaughtering the other. I get that they took them by surprise, but please. It would have added film value to get a tense fight, where you actually wonder whether or not they will succeed. Instead of getting a edge-of-your-seat moment, we got the predictable outcome. It feels like Denis was told to compress the last 1/3 of the film - making it as anticlimactic as possible.The sandworm-ride did make a good scene, but you don't actually see any training whatsoever. So instead of getting psyched up by him succeeding, you end up thinking; could he do this all the time?2. Paul's metamorphose to become the chosen one - or rather the absence of it. Why can't this guy admit that there might be something to the prophecy. I get that his humility is what makes him adequate for the part, but because of his continuing denial of the prophecy, we as audience too lose faith in him as the Kwisatz Haderach. Which, just like the incident of him learning to sandworm-ride, makes an unfulfilling, anticlimactic and awkward transition.3. The weak villains. I was expecting a lot from the villain-side, after Dune 1 where the emperor and baron felt clever and sly. Feyd had a great portrayal in the movie though, but the rest of them seemed frivolous. Seriously, how did the emperor manage to keep his throne for that long, with an army, that with a little surprise, breaks like glass. And Rabban is apparently just a joke despite him actually being sort of scary in Dune 1.In general the Harkonnens seem off by a lot! They get toyed around on multiple occasions, and we in the audience never actually see them as a threat due to their weak portrayal. (We mostly see them kill poor employees)4. Chani and Paul had zero romance. Sorry, but it's true. I want to see them as this meant-to-be couple, but we literally only see them bonding a couple of times. I made the assumption that Chani must be bi-polar; the girl is crazy careful and suspicious of other people several times in the movie, but starts a relationship with Paul based on 2-3 scenes with interaction. People on Tinder tend to talk more with each other before jumping into bed than these two.5. The political aspect - or once again the absence of the same. We hear about these other houses as dangerous and powerful, but where are they? As a viewer who hasn't read the books, I do not have the slightest idea of what these other houses are capable of. This is probably the main reason of the incomplexity of the plot. We don't any political reflections or responses, despite the fact that it must mean a great deal! Without the tangled political game (which I guess is pretty damn important in a world run by houses) the plot becomes predictable on a level which compares to most superhero-movies.Imagine that we had seen the other houses and their beautiful planets. Now THAT would be sci-fi in its glory!!Consider that I had so much against the storytelling (which is the fundamental part of a film) yet still gave it 8/10. I'm surely also going to see it in theaters at least one more time. That goes to show how brilliant the cinematography actually was! Worth watching, not praising.",positive
48,"I have said that Denis Villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen. Dune: Part 2 was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor. Seeing it in IMAX helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewer.Greig Fraser is a master cinematographer. The camera work, coupled with the special effects, have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realism.The stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and
tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be. Believable choreography & acting to boot.A star-studded cast that never outshines their characters - only once I kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery. The story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragging.A fantastic experience with a crowd & another cinematic achievement to add to Denis' filmography that will surely bring him more awards.P.s. Javier Bardem was having a TIME with his role & Austin Butler showed off his range as an actor. Also, loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this year!P.s.s. Can I make ""ride the worm"" a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirty?This is a clear early 2025 Oscar candidate for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Score....potential in acting categories as well...",positive
49,"The true beauty of Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune' films is that if you haven't read the books (which most viewers haven't) - you still get a true sense of the scope of the material.It's epic - massive. And it's on full display in these gorgeous films. Tragedy, horror and honor.The director and writers have done a great service to us all...These are incredible films - films that this ignorant generation, who undoubtebly have no idea of its importance claim their own. Defining an era. Much like Star Wars did in the 70's. This will set the standard. All epic films from this point forward will be judged accordingly...",positive
50,"Honestly, this is the first time I went to watch a movie 3 times in theaters, and I don't regret any time I went to see this movie. It's jist so beautifully put together, words cannot describe how I feel about this movie. You feel everything in this movie, sad, satisfied or excited and even more. Throughout this movie, DV unlocked the feeling of goosebumps and crying for the people who didn't experience this when watching a movie. That speech and ending had me have insane amount of goosebumps and tears. Especially with that Hans Zimmer score, it's one of the best scores in movies ever. It's Hans's best work so far. I feel like each song stuck to a title, being 'Desert Spring'. I felt goosebumps with any score. This movie showed how you introduce a villain, you do not go just saying, ""Oh No! A new threat is coming! I need to get Superman to get him!"".You should definitely go to an IMAX/ Dolby cinema to go watch this. You can see how DV made this especially for IMAX, with the whole movie being shot with IMAX digital cameras. The cinematography done in this is excellent, acting done was also incredible with Timothee Chalamet and Javier Bardem. Zendaya on the other hand can feel a little bit weird as in the book she wasn't this rebel but I can understand how DV makes Zendaya like this because Frank Herbert wanted Paul to be an anti-hero but changing the script a bit can fully convey the message of Paul being an anti-hero.Overall, I want to watch this again as soon as it comes back in IMAX for the third time, but I will look for IMAX GT, to get the full immersive experience of IMAX, I do not want to watch this online because the immersive experience of Dune will be gone as the screen is just too small, even though I have DTS sound system at home. This makes Star Wars sequels look like trash. I hope DV will make Messiah be even better and try and make Alia look like an 'abomination'.",positive
51,"I saw Dune 2 on an XD screen and sound system. Visually, Dune 2 was jaw dropping. The sound was intense, and at times, too loud and droning. If you are interested in seeing this movie, it is worth seeing on a big screen.Though I was fully engaged for its 2 hour and 46 minute run time, I would not call Dune 2 a masterpiece. Most characters acted emotionally flat. I also felt the romance between Paul and Chani was not convincing. When the story was reaching its climax, I did not care about the characters. I also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the Fremen. I get that they are oppressed by the Harkonnen, but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the Harkonnen.Austin Butler was so intense in the movie. It illustrates his acting range. I hope he is recognized for his performance.And here are some little nit-picky criticisms. They don't address how the Fremen eat. In terms of world building, these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable. I'm not convinced humans could survive on Arrakis. There is no way you could grow crops and raise animals. Did they eat synthetic food? The planet also couldn't sustain gigantic worms. These huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day, which is not available. Showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability. And the voice control thing done by the Bene Gesserit is sort of dumb. I know this is from the book, but that part of the book doesn't hold up over time.",neutral
52,"I cried the last few minutes of pure explosion of stimuli. Cinema understanding the spectacle as few filmmakers understand today. A film that I have to process to begin trying to break down but that at first impression I simply have to surrender to that confession that it captivated me through the senses to the point of tears, as I would expect from this type of cinema; which in the last 10 years has fallen and there is no bottom to its decline. I was captured by the sound, by the most crystalline screen I have ever experienced, and since the guttural sound of the opening shook my stomach, I didn't think about anything else for almost 3 hours. I was not a child enjoying it, I was an adult surrendering to the experience. One that I assure you, was a first. 31 years of theaters and Dune 2 made me feel like the first time again.",neutral
53,"I want to love this movie. Despite being in a confused state throughout the film, I enjoyed what I was seeing visually. The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the ""twist"" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.",positive
54,"This second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie. Making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame. Which is logical considering Dune spans several novels with a history of 15.000 years of civilization. Villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling, Which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch. The pacing is irregular, at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed. Especially for people who are not familiair with the original material, you don't get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made. Cramming a story like Dune in a two part sets of films, is probably not doing the story justice, should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work, therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of Dune is very unlikely.",neutral
55,"Denis Villeneuve obviously takes Dune very seriously. As it peaks up right where Part One left off, we remain with 1.5 acts that's left of what I refer to as the Dune Duo. A Part 3 is of course necessary but until we get one, it's a duo. And then it fits perfectly: Part One is 1.5 acts of the story and we're left with a dazzling display of intensity.Hans Zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him, and it shows. After releasing additional 2 albums full of almost 4 hours of music besides the official Dune Part One soundtrack, he continues his quest for the true soul of Dune (in my opinion) - the music.Which leads me to my next point: you HAVE TO watch it in IMAX. It will blow you away. My popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass, and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that I was quite literally jaw dropped.Without giving anything away, Dune Part 2 is just magnificent.",neutral
56,"Well, it certainly seems that this film has produced a whole array of memes within the couple of weeks since it was released in the cinemas. It is almost as if this film has quickly become a cultural phenomena. Like, it's a pretty good film, even if only because of the cinematography, which was absolutely fantastic. Though, having grown up on a steady diet of Lynch's version, I do find myself always comparing this film with that one (I have read the book, but it was ages ago). It also means that I'm pretty familiar with the story.The problem is that there were a number of divergences from the book. For instance, it appears that the time that the events take place have been compressed from three years to one, which means that Alia isn't born (which also means that she doesn't kill the Baron either). Then there is the whole thing about there being two factions, one that is secular and one that is fanatical, and it turns out that Chani is from the secular one, which leads to an interesting ending.Then again, I suspect that the creators assume that most of the audience don't actually know the story. Like, I'm only familiar with it up to the end of the first book, but the film did end on a cliff-hanger, suggesting that there is more to come (something that didn't seem to be the case with the Lynch version - though there is another version that also includes Dune Messiah and Children of Dune).As I mentioned, it was a pretty good film, especially the cinematography - that was amazing. However, my main gripe would be that it felt as if the film ended a bit too quickly, which I have to say is odd for a film that happens to be two and a half hours long. Actually, that was even more strange considering that the battle in the first film seemed to take up half of the film, so I was expecting that the battle here would take about as much time, though it didn't. Also, there didn't seem to be much mention of the wierding way (though it wasn't ignored, it was just that Lynch changed it in his film because I didn't want to do kung-fu on sand dunes).Anyway, yeah, it's certainly worth watching, and despite it being a pretty long film, it did keep me hooked right through to the end.",positive
57,"""Dune: Part Two"" (2024), directed by the masterful Denis Villeneuve, stands as a remarkable sequel that not only lives up to but surpasses its predecessor. Much like the celebrated sequels ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2003), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), this film elevates the franchise to new heights.Villeneuve's atmospheric and deliberately paced direction, complemented by Hans Zimmer's enigmatic score, creates an immersive experience that captivates from the very beginning. The vast, sweeping dunes of sand and the breathtaking scenes of giant-worm riding traverse the expansive desert landscape, leaving audiences mesmerized throughout.The introduction of Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha adds a compelling layer of malevolence, while the demise of the Harkonnen leader is satisfyingly intricate, avoiding simplicity. The film culminates in an epic duel between Paul Atreides and Feyd-Rautha, delivering an elegantly crafted and thrilling conclusion.Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet's performance as Paul Atreides, the prophesied Lisan al-Gaib, is nothing short of extraordinary. His portrayal of the chosen leader is so captivating that it becomes impossible to look away from the screen. The narrative remains faithful to Frank Herbert's novel, capturing the essence of the epic tale while hinting that ""the war has just begun.""While the novel doesn't extend to a Part Three, the expansive universe of Dune offers numerous sequels in the books. With the right efforts and approvals, there is hope for more cinematic adaptations in the future. For now, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a monumental achievement that demands to be seen, and I eagerly anticipate experiencing it again, this time with my beloved by my side.",positive
58,"Tightly written, well acted focused Saga story! The writing is without a wasted scene. The acting fulfills the purpose of the story. While none of the actors will win any acting awards, the overall product makes this lengthy movie, flyby and leave you wanting more. Well done!The story succeeds, despite the fact that the characters are functionaries in the goal of the story. None of them are well drawn and multidimensional. Apart from this, the nuance of the purpose of the story drives you in and makes you care about them.There is satisfaction when the evil people get there just desserts. You feel great when characters are reunited. You feel sorrow when there are emotional defeats. ""Feel"" is the main message here. The spectacle delivers.",positive
59,"Denis Villeneuve never fails to amaze on how beautiful his movies look. And this one is no exception.Of course it has more action than the first one cause is the full on development of the (anti) hero's journey of Paul ""Muad'dib"" Atreides. Therefore, it showcases more depth and details, plus good plot twists, that justifies the journey and conflict.But also, by having more storylines, the pace and edition style feels rushed in some moments. The storytelling with its half-explained moments and all of a sudden time jumps doesn't gives the same fluidity that the first one had.There are several backstories that needed more buildup or evidence to be believable, or else, less cutting out details from the book (even though that means longer movies and more fast & furious type of movie fans complaining about ""way too long"" movies).Of course, the ending is grandiloquent as a space opera like Dune should be. But the first two acts of the movie could have been better. Not in its photography, music or overall production value (which are amazing), just in the telling of a story that evidently has a lot of branches that needed more room to grow.",positive
60,"This is a fantastic film. To me, it was almost perfect! Acting is fantastic and the visuals are out-of-this-world. I was enthralled throughout my whole time in the cinema. I happily saw it twice and wish I'd taken the time to see it a third time as I never saw it in IMAX. It was the best cinema experience I've ever had and I fully believe that you will love it too.If anyone else enjoys Timothee Chalamet's acting, I would also recommend The King (2019). He was great in that as Henry V and I'm sure his performance contributed to his casting in Dune (2021).However, I can see why some people were frustrated by the plot. Having never read the book, I don't know the full extent of the changes but I do understand that it was deemed ""unfilmable"" back in 1984 when the first attempt was released. (Which reminds me a bit of a serious take on Flash Gordon or something.) Anyway, this (as well as Part 1) are very streamlined. It feels fast-paced and eventful. Which I really enjoyed as I didn't need everything. The world-building was enough but, if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, this might not be what you are looking for. I don't know.I guess one issue I had was that the discussion of Paul as the Lisan-Al-Gaib reminded me of the discussion of Brian as the Messiah in Life of Brian. Which I personally found to be hilarious, and it felt like a deliberate homage as the actors seemed to find it funny when they were speaking the lines, but it did take me out of the story a little when I watched it at home.Finally, when I saw this at home on the ""small screen"" I really enjoyed it. However, it was simply not the same. All of the visuals were limited by comparison and while I refer to it as the ""small screen"" this was on a relatively large screen. (I own a projector that was probably projecting somewhere around 80"").As a result, while I will advise that you see this film in any format that is available to you but (if you can) keep an eye on any cinema / IMAX re-releases. You will not regret it. It was simply amazing on the big screen.Saying this, it is still my favourite film of 2024 by far!",positive
61,"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE: PART TWO is a review-proof film. Either you watched - and loved - the first part, in which case you have already gone out and seen it. Or...you didn't like the first part (or didn't watch it), in which case you are not going to the Cineplex to check out the sequel.If you ARE going to see this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possible...for 2 reasons.Reason 1: This film is visually and audibly stunning. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. Director Villeneuve (and all involved in the production, costume, sound and Fx design) have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first Dune and expect this film to rake in ALL of these types of awards come next Oscars' season. They visually (and audibly) credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when (in fact) it is all pretty much green sky. An amazing technical achievementReason 2: It's a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning, because the storyline itself, is rather boring and somewhat complex. This is the fault of the source novel as Dune (and it's sequels) are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a Messiah (with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters - never a good way to present a movie). So you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot (as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone, pet the dog, go make a sandwich etc.) and not miss some of the intricacies.Caught between Reason 1 and Reason 2 are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of Dune: Part Two while acting against a green screen with some long, boring speeches and some very clunky dialogue.Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling all return from the first part and they are ""just fine"", not really elevating things, but not bringing them down either. They gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless job.Thank goodness Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgard and (especially) Christopher Walken (!) are wasted in their roles, really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting character.Only Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings new excitement to the 2nd half of this 2 hour and 40 minute epic and, by that point in this film, it is much needed.Come to DUNE: PART TWO for the visual and sound achievements and stay for...the visual and sound achievements - and the setup to the inevitable sequel.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",positive
62,"I was only mildly impressed with ""Dune"" (2021). It was a HUGE improvement over David Lynch's 1980s version, that's for sure. But it was also very slow and showed little in the way of characters and personalities. It was big...but also a bit disappointing despite this bigness. Fortunately, this second film, while also slow, is a bit more interesting to watch and it's battle scenes must have been truly amazing to watch on the big screen. And, fortunately, it also gives does a bit more in making a few of the major characters more fully fleshed out an interesting. While not a perfect version of the second portion of the Frank Herbert book, it is very good and well worth seeing.My only regrets about the film were minimal. First, the worm scenes were far less interesting than I'd hoped as you barely see them and they only come partially out of the ground. Also, I had to laugh at how many of the battles involved swords...in a sci-fi epic?! So many swords...when a machine gun or tank would have been so much better! Still, these are very minor quibbles and the film is well worth your time.I might say more but there are well over 2000 reviews. So, 'nuff said.",positive
63,"This movie is visually well done, for 80% of it shot in the bright sun of a desert. The sound is also great, but I wouldn't call it music so much as tones. It fits though. More like something seen in a t.v. Show then the epic music that Danny Elfman or John Williams bring.The writers really didn't read the books, did they? Like the first film but even worse, this was a child's Cliff Notes version of the actually books. To know the storyline you'd have to have read the books or watched the previous, superior versions. Chani is especially poorly done and again the characters are mostly just long gazes.I understand the simpletons who enjoyed the visuals. This movie has made a good deal of money but there's a reason it won't ever reach a billion mark like truly epic films. And the IMDB meter on this will probably drop closer to my score as non-fanatics see this film over the coming years. Again, the 3-part Frank Herbert miniseries is the best, the 1984 is the classic nostalgia and this one looks pretty but says very little.",positive
64,"First of all, part one was pretty good, fast pace some talking , but not much, a fast pace movie I enjoyed, overall a very good movie.The overall part 2 is boring not the actors fault though, rather it's the script that is dragging its feet nowhere because it's badly written so bad it becomes a snooze, at the end of the day it's boring and we've lost interest. Characters spend some much time talking philosophizing whining and complaining you wonder why a production would spend millions on such a badly written boring story. That's the trend these days, when a network wants to cut down expenses it's making characters blob to death.Chalamet not my cup of tea in this part 2, he looks out of place, feels more like a choir boy rather than an action movie hero.Part 2 misses the mark.",positive
65,"A real movie captivates through compelling storytelling, strong character development, and immersive visuals and sound. It transcends mere entertainment to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and resonate with audiences on a deeper level. Today, cinema needs to balance innovation with tradition, blending advanced technology like CGI with strong narrative substance to meet audience expectations. Modern viewers seek originality, relatability, and escapism. ""Dune: Part Two"" is highly anticipated because it promises a continuation of an epic saga with rich world-building, intricate plots, and high production values, fulfilling the desire for both spectacle and meaningful content.",neutral
66,"Dune Part Two is a film by Denis Villeneuve from 2024.DUNE: PART TWO"" tells the story of the mythical journey of Paul Atreides, who, with the help of Chani and the Fremen, embarks on a campaign of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Young Paul is faced with the choice between the love of his life and the fate of the entire universe. But he must try by all means to prevent a terrible future - a future that no one but him can foresee.Denis Villeneuve returns with extremely impressive images: ""Dune: Part Two"" is a monumental film that largely rejects the usual blockbuster spectacle and instead reflects almost contemplatively on power and domination. This long-awaited film is therefore a multi-layered commentary on our (geopolitical) present, in which the voices of reason are hardly heard anymore. Villeneuve leads us to a dead end, or rather: we suddenly slide into an abyss - and it is no longer so easy to determine how this could have happened.",positive
67,"The ending really ruined the film for me. The strong love and relation between Paul and Chani is lost, love which is very clearly seen in the whole first 3 books. Giving Chani a bigger role was ok but not at the expense of breaking the love between them. Having read the first book a few times and having seen the 80's movie and 90's TV series I will only say this: it ruined the whole movie for me.I did expect some changes and different artistic views but this was way too much.Except one time where was Paul's Bene Gesserit training in the whole movie??? Which by the way helped him overcome a lot in his journey.",positive
68,"""Dune: Part 1"" and ""Dune: Part 2"" are films that define what sci-fi should be - an epic with a grand scale and an incredible story.I love Herbert's novel and until Villeneuve's films, I believed that this was the type of story that could not be translated into a picture. Jesus, how wrong I was! It's an absolute masterpiece and something that lives in you. Some may be turned off by the fact that the entire film is based mainly on dialogues and building relationships, but I am sure that for those few, including myself, it will be a masterpiece on par with Star Wars for our fathers. This is what genre cinema should look like, not robots saving the galaxy and women in tight leggings jumping on buildings (yes, I'm talking about you Marvel)The best movie I've seen in many, many, many years :)",positive
69,"Dune: Part 2"" is an exceptional continuation of the epic saga that left audiences eagerly anticipating more. From the very start, the film captivates with its breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling, transporting viewers to the mystical and dangerous world of Arrakis.The plot is filled with intense moments and unexpected twists, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. The character development is deep and compelling, with performances that bring depth and nuance to the iconic figures of the Dune universe.One of the standout elements of ""Dune: Part 2"" is its otherworldly soundtrack. The music, composed by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complements the grand scale of the film, enhancing the emotional and dramatic impact of each scene. It's a sonic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.Overall, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a cinematic triumph. It's a masterful blend of action, drama, and science fiction, delivering an immersive and unforgettable experience. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or new to the Dune universe, this film is a must-watch.",neutral
70,"Just got out of the early access screening, and all I can say is wow. Truly blew my mind, from start to finish, the film keeps the foot on the gas peddle and doesn't allow you to breath even for a second.The arena has got to be one of my favourite scenes in any movie, the cinematography, colour, score and performance by Butler is truly a sight to behold.Outstanding performances by Timothe and Butler, with Timothe showing his range throughout the course of the movie, morphing into the thing he tries to avoid the most, and Butler playing the psychopath amazingly well. One you want to see in IMAX, memorable experience.",positive
71,"I really liked Dune Part One. So much so I saw it three times in the theater and twice streaming. I was really looking forward to Part Two. Aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for me.I felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of Part One. Saw this is Dolby Cinema. Sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying. It made it hard to follow what was happening.And then there were a couple of other things: The Stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon. It seemed out of character from how Bardem delivered him in Part One.And oh, how about Zendaya? If this was the first time I saw her on screen I'd say keep your day job. For some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes! It was bizarre.Don't get me wrong, however, I still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch. I just think Part One is measurably better.",neutral
72,"IMAX is definitely the way to see this. It's a big, loud,
more action-focused installment. I loved part one and was so excited for this that I couldn't help but be disappointed by multiple aspects:-The editing was jarring at times. A scene would suddenly end and the next scene is a completely different setting, apparently at some future (but unknown) date. This occurs multiple times.-The Baron (and to a lessor extent Rabban) are dramatically reduced as characters in Part 2. I know he was poisoned, but the Baron was a terrifying figure in Part 1 and is barely even a threat in Part 2. Austin Butler is great, but he's hardly in the movie.-All the talk of Messiah and Holy War are repeated many times, but I was never sold on it. Paul's refusal to venture south for so long felt more annoying than earned. I'm sure the book does a much better job, but this is the movie. Also, I couldn't help but laugh every time Jessica said her daughter (a fetus) was asking questions.Everything else was great. It's a true epic. I'm
Just one of the few that slightly preferred part one.",positive
73,"Dune part two is definitely an entertaining movie, but as it stands as an 8.8, lets dial it back a bit. The movie itself visually is a masterpiece, but my problem stems from character development and plot rushing. To me it seems like the last half of the movie was supposed to be 3 hours long itself but the whole movie itself was cut under 3 hours. The climactic finish to the film was super fast and felt like the stakes were low because it just went from one thing to the next with no time to breathe. Also Pauls attraites or how ever you spell it, his character pulls a game of thrones esque queem of dragons vibe, where there goals and personality are one thing then dramatically shift seemingly out of no where. Overall it was a good film, a bit long for my taste, but Its worth a watch if you like sci fi.",positive
74,"The perception of this movie really depends on several factors: books read, Lynch's version watched, inclination to SF (and any combination thereto) or none of that. No one can deny that visuals in this movie are fantastic (including SFX), but what else there is? Some occasional acting (strictly routine, nothing enthusiastic), strange editing (at moments being nonsense - the short scene wit Paul drinking water of life), routine music (lately modern woman's voice screaming, or ""vocalizing"", as they like to say), bad writing, uneven pace, no science and a lot of fiction. If one wants great visuals with dense substance, right pacing, music, editing and direction (with occasional connection to the literary template by P. Dick), one should watch Blade Runner by Ridley Scott, for example. Dune has nothing to do with it. The books are too complex for a literal adaptation anyway. Second part has more substance than the first one, but stretched and lost in (too) long ""symbolic"" shots of everything else. Almost typical modern Hollywood. So, if you'e among first three mentioned categories - avoid disappointment. The rest might find it even great (although they cannot explain why). Pity.",positive
75,"This movie grabs you by the throat from the very first and keeps you engaged throughout. The visuals are stunning and there is finally a little (I mean a little) more time spent developing plot lines in a more digestible format. In the first Dune, characters appeared and disappeared so quickly that you really didn't care what happened to them. Dune 2 is very long, but I guess that's a given with such a dense story.What is missing is any true connection made with the characters. There is no exploration of Paul's inner thoughts or struggles or conflicts, he's just always the hero. The love story doesn't develop, it just happens, and Zendaya basically just scowls or looks confused throughout the movie. Also, there is so much crammed into the movie that there were plot leaps that weren't fully explained, so that diminishes your full investment, you just let the visuals and spectacle roll over you. To be a successful movie doesn't mean that every book element needs to be included; editing would have created a more well-rounded and emotionally impactful flick.I do recommend, as a spectacle and fascinating other world creation. But great it is not in other aspects.",positive
76,"""Dune: Part Two"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic saga, deserving a perfect 10/10 for its intricate storytelling, breathtaking visual effects, and the depth of its political and romantic subplots.One of the most captivating elements of ""Dune: Part Two"" is the love story between Paul Atreides (Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya). Their relationship is developed with a genuine emotional depth that enhances the film's narrative. The chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya is palpable, adding a layer of warmth and humanity amidst the grandiose and often harsh environment of Arrakis. Their love story is not just a subplot but a driving force that shapes their characters' motivations and decisions, making the audience deeply invested in their journey.The exploration of different factions and space politics is another area where ""Dune: Part Two"" excels. Denis Villeneuve masterfully delves into the complex political landscape of the Dune universe, where alliances are fragile, and power struggles are constant. The depiction of the various factions, including the noble House Atreides, the sinister House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic Bene Gesserit, is detailed and compelling. Each faction's distinct motivations and strategies are intricately woven into the plot, creating a rich tapestry of intrigue and conflict.The film's visual effects continue to be a standout feature, with the same level of artistry and attention to detail that made the first installment so visually stunning. The landscapes of Arrakis are rendered with breathtaking realism, and the depiction of the space battles and the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes immerse the audience in this vast and detailed universe.Villeneuve's direction ensures that every frame serves the story, balancing grand epic moments with intimate character-driven scenes. The pacing of the film is expertly managed, with each scene building on the previous one to create a crescendo of tension and excitement. The fight scenes are choreographed with precision, making them feel both brutal and graceful, and the strategic battles highlight the tactical brilliance of the characters involved.The performances are uniformly excellent. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet continues to impress as Paul Atreides, capturing the complexity of a young man burdened with immense destiny. Zendaya brings strength and sensitivity to her role as Chani, while the supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd, deliver powerful performances that add depth to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of the saga, blending a captivating love story with intricate political intrigue and stunning visual effects. It not only meets but exceeds the high expectations set by its predecessor, making it a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. This film cements the Dune series as a landmark in cinematic history and deserves a perfect 10/10.",positive
77,"*NON-SPOILER REVIEW*Wow! This is just beyond. Beyond my imagination. Beyond what I was expecting. Beyond all previous iterations of this story put to film. Such an epic! Can't wait for more of this Saga Ô£ø√º√≤√§Ô£ø√º√≤√¢I was quite surprised they didn't do a weird time jump. I loved the fan intro before the film and they called it a saga, so...I'm expecting they are making more, but I heard recently, this is the last Dune film from this director sadly. I hope they take this like they did Harry Potter and keep the same style and fluidity.This film definitely had more action that the first film. They got up close and in person with it, which worked really well.Great character development which wasn't rushed. The love story played well and I'd expect they add a little more if they do a director's cut or something.Cinematography was epic like the previous film Ô£ø√º√©‚Ä¢Acting was great and it was nice to see the diversity in actors.The whole design of the film with all its visuals, costumes, sound design, stunts and choreography, set design, etc., etc., were fantastic.The ""Narrating"" was done properly and not distracting.I'm honestly not sure how they can top this one.P.

78,"Austin Butler sheds his Elvis accent while Timothee Chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the Fremen's messiah.Dune: Part Two is an absolute sci-fi masterpiece. Director Denis Villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics, religion, and romance.The acting here is fantastic with standouts being Austin Butler, who is psychotic and creepy as Feyd-Rautha, along with Rebecca Ferguson, who takes on something totally different than the last film's characterization of Lady Jessica.Greig Fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team. This group is incredibly talented, using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms, spaceships, and otherworldly armies.The sound mixing department and Hans Zimmer's score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening IMAX theater experience. This film is so loud and grand.I also respect how Denis Villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming Sicario: he doesn't want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims. While the film is visually stunning, the violence is what it is. It's brutal and not over the top.Overall, Dune showcases the best sci-fi has to offer with a great adaptation of Frank Herbert's space drama created with top tier acting and production.",positive
79,"For one of the many book readers, all I have to say is WOW! I've read a lot of books that utterly fail in adapting the book but Denis adapts Dune perfectly. This is a sci-fi epic masterpiece. I know people who have not read the book and they are absolutely in love with Part 2. What makes apart 2 so amazing is how great of a job Denis did with Part 1. The perfect set up movie for the ultimate showdown and the growth of a boy into a man and from a man into a Messiah. Chalamet does a superb job in growing not only as an actor but as man becoming himself and learning the ways of the world. Please go see Part 2 as quickly as possible and in IMAX. This movie deserves to go down as one of, if not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time. IMAX IMAX IMAX.",positive

Now the holy war begins.This is my humble opinion expresses trough AI.""Dune 2"" is a cinematic marvel that captivates with stunning visuals and a gripping story. Like the first movie, it shows vast, barren worlds that seem colorless but are filled with vivid details. The film dives into the holy war, raising the stakes and intensity. Each scene is beautifully crafted, pulling viewers into the epic saga. The performances are strong, the music is haunting, and the direction is visionary. ""Dune 2"" not only meets the high expectations set by the first film but also expands the universe in exciting and profound ways.",neutral
81,"Dune 2 is a big screen action/adventure spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, maybe the first Dune in 2021. But when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly, this sophomore sequel doesn't quite hit it out of the park.For a very basic overview, Dune 2 picks up with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) living amongst the Fremen after House Atreides being all but wiped out in the House Harkonnen collaboration with the Emperor's army to re-take Arrakis. Though Jessica and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) continue to tout Paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the Bene Gesserit religious sect, Paul isn't yet convinced-nor are other Fremen like Chani (Zendaya). Will Paul accept the mantle and risk all-out religious war-or choose to remain embedded ""locally"" with the Fremen? Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is struggling to control spice production on Arrakis, so unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is called in for assistance. Finally, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinations.There is absolutely no doubt that Dune 2 is cinema spectacle of the highest order. Director Denis Villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible (to truly appreciate the scale) and within the best sound structure (Dolby Atmos for me and it was theater-rumbling!). There is never a dull moment from beginning to end-always something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screen.Here's the issue with Dune 2: the first film was one of the best world-building setups I've ever seen in a flick. It expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict, gradually built up the key characters, and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue. While this sequel technically pays off all those setups, it doesn't always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways. I won't go into every nook and cranny here, but a few examples:-Paul resists his messianic calling the entire film-until the end when he just ""gives in""?-The fetus within Jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be Anya Taylor-Joy's brief cameo character?-Even after Paul accepts his mantle-the Houses won't acknowledge him?-The bombshell of Paul's more-diverse-than-we-realized bloodline came off as anticlimactic, especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the film's endgame.I know that there is an answer to every question posed above-but none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me. Part of the problem could be that I was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a ""setting up a franchise"" denouement instead. A particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was Butler's Feyd-Rautha. Why? Because-like in Dune 1-it was something completely different/new and shrouded in mystery that Villeneuve was able to unwind.So, in my final reckoning of Dune 2, the visual spectacle and star-studded cast do most of the heavy-lifting. If you don't see this one from a theater seat at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. But if you are looking for a plot-tight, perfectly character-fulfilling narrative, you may walk away a little disappointed (at least compared to the first Villeneuve Dune).",positive
82,"This movie was a masterpiece. It's a 600 word requirement for this review so I will say this film had me feel the same vibes you get when you watch the very first Matrix. Worm scene was incredible. Building up Feyd Rautha character was done so well. Excited for a 3rd but it will be hard to imagine how it can be better than this part two which was head & shoulders better than part one. Action was non stop & once again shout out to the greatest movie soundtrack composer of all time Hans Zimmer. He is a national treasure. If you have a favourite movie that comes to mind, Hans was probably behind the musical score behind it. True Legend.",positive
83,"Dune Part 2 is a visually stunning yet somewhat disjointed cinematic experience.Villeneuve's direction is undeniably ambitious, and his signature style of breathtaking visuals is on full display in Dune. The black and white scenes, reminiscent of archival footage from fascist Germany, are particularly striking and add a unique aesthetic to the storytelling.However, the overall pacing and editing of the film leave something to be desired. The narrative flow is often disrupted by abrupt cuts and seemingly unconnected scenes. It appears that an abundance of material was shot, and the process of trimming it down to a manageable length may have been a challenging one. Despite these efforts, the film still clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours and 46 minutes.The plot of Dune Part 2 bears some resemblance to the TV series Game of Thrones, with its complex political machinations, warring factions, and power struggles. However, the film's storytelling falls short in comparison to the depth and intricacy of the HBO series. The limited runtime of a theatrical release may have constrained the filmmakers' ability to fully explore the richness of the source material. Perhaps a television adaptation would have been a more suitable format to delve into the nuances of the Dune universe and its characters.In terms of performances, Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha is a standout. Butler brings a magnetic presence and charisma to the role, overshadowing even the lead actor, Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides. Chalamet struggles to match the intensity and allure of Butler's Feyd-Rautha, and his performance is merely a shadow in comparison.Overall, Dune Part 2 is a film that aspires to greatness but falls short in its execution. The visual spectacle and moments of brilliance are undeniable, but the disjointed narrative and uneven pacing prevent it from fully realizing its potential.",positive
84,"You would expect a dramatization of this calibre to paint a picture with all the colors of the original story - the ambient backstory of an interstellar empire, the role of the Spice as the only way to traverse the vast space between the planets, the intricate politics around the control of it, the infinite double helix of plans within plans, the clash of civilizations and prophecies, the mutual development of the characters within the story, the specter of philosophies and their cradles.Well, If you did, you were dead wrong.All you get is some sturm-und-drang CGI, somewhat fancy panoramas backed by the same old, supposedly, dramatic third-grade Middle Eastern-ish cheesy flute-chants, Fashion Channel panning shots of models in unnatural poses and, well, no and. That's about it.The acting is pathetic, for the most part. An otherwise fantastic cast of legendary actors were put to reciting stiff dialogue, barely hiding their confusion.Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",positive
85,"Denis Villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with Dune Part 2 being possibly his greatest movie so far.Dune Part 2 is everything you want for a sequel. It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.This movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.Visually and technically this movie is masterpiece.There are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.Direction and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.Storywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timoth‚àö¬©e Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen ""jihad messiah"" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timoth‚àö¬©e Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.However, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.Firstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.Secondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the ""epicness"" ""darkness"" and sense of ""doom"" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.Other movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.Despite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.Rating: 8,5 stars.",positive
86,"Cinematography is visually stunning and awe inspiring. The sound design is incredible, especially of the weaponry. The rifle shots look and sound futuristic yet realistic. Captures the essence of the book while cutting out superfluous parts of the book and also avoiding some of the controversial stuff like the Harah character. The entire cast nail their performances. I do wish Denis left in the ecology bits but I understand runtime had to be kept to a reasonable length. Ending was changed to be more female empowering than the book I guess. Chani overall was a bit more independent and less ""submissive."" In the book Chani accepts some ""traditional"" gender roles while in the movie it clear that Chani is never subservient to Paul. I knew they would ""update"" the story for today's society so the changes expected.",neutral
87,"What a looker Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet is. With his green eyes, androgynous face and smooth curly hair, he is so photogenic all the time, that if you were to pause this movie at certain moments, you could swear the still is from one of those fancy fashion commercials he's recently been in under the direction of Martin Scorsese. And Denis Villeneuve knows this.So much so, in fact, that he's decided to hype us up even more in ""Part Two"", again taking his time, making sure the light on Chalamet's should-be insured face falls at the perfect angle and each grain of sand is venerated akin to ""Lawrence of Arabia""--the timeless masterpiece epic that Villeneuve also adores. So yeah, the teasing here has intensified; but so did the good things: the anti-elitist themes found in Frank Herbert's novel now go deeper into themes of faith, religion and manipulation; the scope is grander; the cinematography? Jaw-dropping! Especially the black and white homeworld of the Harkonnen, Giedi Prime, on which Austin Butler's villainous Feyd-Rautha steals the show in terms of performance as he spills black blood on white skin. And for the first time in Villeneuve's career, there are genuinely funny moments too.Overall, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a better movie than its predecessor. And it's quite a feat to be so without changing or eliminating the flaws of the first movie. Instead, Villeneuve proves that he is fully committed to thoroughly dissecting Herbert's novel to its full power. And it pays off. Even if there is no catharsis in ""Part Two"", the hype train we are being taken over is dense and brutal. Without going into the chunky plot, just know that by the end we are left with one of the greatest cliffhangers in cinema history in which good and evil alternates between characters and the stage is fully set for what's to come.Is a dangerous game director/writer Denis Villeneuve is playing by making so many promises. Or maybe it's not. I am sure a lot of people already felt fully satisfied with this movie even at this point. My friend whom I saw the movie with absolutely swears by it, calling it one of the greatest sci-fi movies in recent history. Me? I hope to be able to say the same about its sequel--or sequels? Because if they will turn up on par with their hype, my friend will be absolutely right.",positive
88,"Villeneuve wanted this movie to stand on its two feet, will still being a continuation of the last film. It delivers on both fronts. The quality of the shots, acting, pacing is still there from the last movie. You can put both parts together as one movie and it would work. The dream sequences were not as impactful as they were in the last movie, and almost non existent when Paul is enlightened by prescience. If we were to look through his mind like it was in the book, the message of the danger of charismatic leaders might have been less impactful.With only a few flaws and nitpicks, Dune Part 2 is worthy of a watch.",neutral
89,"While it without a doubt is a masterclass in editing, cinematography, SOUND DESIGN :0, casting I can't seem to ignore the glaring flaws. The cast as expected is masterclass and I especially really enjoyed Bardem and Butler this time around and Denis will most likely get a best director nomination next year.Even though there is no doubt about its ""epicness"" I found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one. Somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second act.The third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in Messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt. I would have liked to expand the third act maybe 20 more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did. I might pump this up to a 9 if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manner.Overall a great film with many flaws that I unfortunately can't look past. It is one of the great modern sci fi's but dare I say, didn't exactly live up to the hype. See it at the biggest screen possible, 8/10.",positive
90,"When I first watched Dune two years ago I couldn't get enough of the story or the surrounding lore. I read the first book soon after as to immerse myself in knowing what would happen next and to have a better knowledge of the universe. At the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that I felt were important in establishing the overall story, however after watching the second part I understand what Denis Villeneuve's vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction. The battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of Paul training was a fun experience. I'm sad to see the whole story arc of Thufir Hawat as well as Paul's child and his bizarre sister being dropped, but I understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things aren't as necessary/needed to build for future installments. I loved this movie, it was such a great sequel and is helping further the vision of Frank Herbert.",positive
91,"I see quite a lot of positive reviews here from younger audiences. It seems dune struck a cord in all born after 2000. Which I guess is a good thing. Calling it the best movie of all time is something else. It means you first have to watch all films of all time to make such a bold assessment. And secondly Villeneuves rendering needs to be something special. It is not.There has been other and better movies displaying the same story line, scenes and composition. Sorry to disappoint you Gen-Zers or below.Even Frank Herbert confest himself to be inspired by Lawrence of Arabia. Now this film is one you need to see (no sand worms there unfortunately)The story-arch and intrigues are also not new. Even cliche. The high-rise hero falling for the lowly dame and ultimately dump her? Nothing new (but Dune 5 will show something different) Apart from the well orchestrated mass fight and one on one fight scenes we have seen way to often this movie has very little to offer. There really is no suprise only quite a lot of wasted talent on Rampling and Walker (those are boomers btw) There is no surprise, no novelty in this movie. It is a boring arrangement of boring repeats. Even Hans went back to a repetition of what we have heard (before Interstallar, that was truy awesome)If you want to see a movie in the desert go watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want to see a messias go watch Matrix. If you want to see a good sci fi movie go see, ehm. 2001?",positive
92,"It seems that many movies have become increasingly longer and longer and we groan and bemoan this fact. But Dune Part II left me wanting more. I would love to see an extended edition of this film. It is a film that is visually and sonically stunning. Go and see it on the biggest screen as possible. Fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book. Yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the Fremon people, whose long awaited messiah emerges. This is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen. Does it surpass Dune Part One? Yes. What about Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back. I don't think so but let me go and watch it again and again before I make such an assessment. I am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie. Maybe even a fourth. Go and Watch this movie. It is mesmerizing.",positive
93,"First of all, too many changes from the book in my opinion. The characters felt a bit off. I loved much of the visuals in the film, I like the world they created, felt in line with the book and I liked the choices for the actors portraying Harkonnens especially, however, the emperor just bothered me, I thought it was such a horrible choice, just terrible, otherwise a decent cast overall that fits with the descriptions of the characters.There were many scenes added that were not in the book and some characters were entirely removed. They were not necessarily bad if you didn't read the book, like the killing of the baron, it worked, but I couldn't help but think about that. Also the child he had with Chani is not mentioned. His little sister would have been a great, twisted character but that was removed too... small things here and there that just lowered my enjoyment of the film.It is also crazy long. By the end of it I couldn't wait to leave the theatre.In the end, I feel like it was great visually but I felt that it changed details that I thought needed not changing so that lowered my enjoyment of this film considerably. If I was to go back in time I'd probably watch it at home on my tv instead of the theatre. Worth watching but I think that all the praises it's getting are a bit exaggerated, but definitely better than the garbage Disney puts out, so maybe that's why people love it so much.",positive
94,"Dune was written in 1965, and it stood the test of time. By making a movie named Dune, why dont u stick by source material? What is this irresistible urge to alter a perfect story with ur mediocre ideasI will come to straight to point.1) U ruined the character of Paul. He is a prophet figure, who never wanted war, but he was forced to choose that way because it was the only way. Yet in the final scenes, he ""ordered"" his men to go and fight. He never did anything like this in the books. ""Take them to Paradise""?? Wtf!2) It was the sister Alia, who despite being child came to Throne Room, killed Baron, threatened Reverend Mother, laughed at Emperor. She achieved many more feats. But she wasn't even born in this movie. Wtf!3) How long is Paul's mother going to be pregnant? How ridiculous this is? Paul was exiled, and then he formed an army, and conquered a planet, yet his mother is still pregnant? Wtf!4) I was most upset by Chani. The book Chani, I love her. She supported Paul the most, She loved Paul so much, She was Paul's everything. They also had a son by this time. Paul married Princess Irulan, but never touched her. Chani understood it was a political marriage, it was to save her planet. Chani in the books is so intelligent, calm, brave and she respects Paul.In the movie, Chani is only making faces on everything Paul is doing.. When every Fremen is supporting Paul, his own wife which is supposed to support him, is against him.. When he ascended to power in the caves infront of all Fremen, she is the only one defying him! Wtf is this character assassination? The ending actually made me like wtf did I watch? My Gf asked me if Chani is going to be against Paul in the next movie, and my only reply was that they assassinated her character.. I need to calm down. Deep Breaths....5) Where is the spice guild? Spice Guild, Emperor and Great Houses, they form the whole power system, each holding 1/3rd of the power. They were shown in the 1st movie when they didn't deviate from books. They had a major role in the throne room negotiations, but Wow! They weren't even in the movie itself!! Wtf!There are some good things also.As I already mentioned, Dune 1 was very good. I recommended that movie to many many people. First half of Dune 2 was also good. Cinematography, Music, the Grandness. But they ruined the second half, especially the ending when it ended on the face of very very angry Chani.They did same with Witcher, with Game of Thrones, they ruined MCU too. Why cant they respect the original writer who thought all this, & the original story (which made it famous in the first place). Why cant hollywood stick to the source material with minor tweaking, rather than completely messing with it in the wrong way? The way things are looking, Dune 3 is going to be further away from the books.",positive
95,"This was a more than competent follow up to 2021's ""Dune"", which didn't carry a 'Part 1' included in the title. As an early 2024 movie release, much of its impact will be gone by the time the next awards season arrives, but true film fans will recognize it as a top contender for the year's best, even if we've got more than a half year to go yet as I write this. Visually, the picture is more than impressive, however I was expecting more from the scenes of the Shai-Hulud, the giant sand worm that the story's hero summoned to demonstrate his acceptance as the Muad 'Dib of the Fremen people, 'The One Who Points the Way'. The one Paul Atreides (Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet) rode was all but invisible, contrasted with those scenes in which a sand worm engulfed enemies of the Fremen earlier in the picture, reminiscent of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pet Sarlacc from ""Star Wars"".One thing that seemed ambiguous was the relationship between Paul and Chani (Zendaya). At times her facial and body language showed disapproval with Paul, even as they expressed their undying love for each other. I can only attribute that to the fact that Paul was an outsider to the Fremens, and his stature as the future Lisan al-Gaib might have been considered heretical. Even so, her obvious disapproval with Paul at various times felt out of place, except near the end when Paul expressed his willingness to marry Princess Iluran (Florence Pugh), daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) right after he told Chani he would love her forever. At that point it felt like Paul was acting more on his own behalf in a quest for power than what was appropriate for the Fremens.A major surprise for this viewer was the casting of Austin Butler in the role of Feyd-Rautha, nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd). I didn't recognize the 'Elvis"" actor in his albino guise as the promised future Emperor. Once again, in terms of an ambiguous outcome, I couldn't perceive how Paul reversed his enemy's knife to defeat Feyd-Rautha in the final contest for the Emperor's throne. And finally, how we've gotten this far into the story to find out only now that Paul's mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) was a Harkonnen was quite troubling. How would Paul's deceased father not have known, and consequently, the viewer. That twist sort of defied one's understanding of the relationships among the principal characters.Lastly, where one might have expected a definitive resolution to the Dune saga, the story leaves threads hanging with the impending birth of the mystical baby girl carried by Reverend Mother Jessica, and the fierce resolve of Chani in abandoning Paul. I had not gone beyond the original Frank Herbert ""Dune"" novel myself, and this film's conclusion points me in the direction of following up with 'Dune Messiah"".",positive
96,"Before I get Into detail about this movie I just want to say that it's a fantastic movie and it's everything I wanted from the sequel.The story is on point. It's very well paced and it doesn't drag like some parts of the first movie. The dialogue is well written, and impactful.The main character arc is awesome. The story arc of other supporting characters is also very well done. They have great character development. The new antagonist is awesome.The production value was very good. The score like the last film was amazing. The editing was on point. I just have nothing but good things to say about this movie.",positive
97,"There are a few films that define the time. I had Star Wars trilogy as a kid, my first son had LOTR, the second had Harry Potter... and then for while it seemed like we were left with unending marvel tripe, embarrassing butchering of Star Wars franchise and shallow remakes of, well... everything.And now, finally, I can say that my third son has a movie for his generation. Beautiful, complex, thought-provoking and epic. The movie that can extend his world into a fantasy realm that's not about wearing latex and shooting everything that moves. It's movie where nuance is discovered through many conversations with friends and lessons learned through experiencing the real world with the new lens.Amazing.",positive
98,"Unlike Dune Part 1, the wonderful other-worldly music in Dune Part 2 didn't drown out the soft-spoken dialogues. That said, by the sparse music soundtrack, my hunch is the producers, director, and music editors went too far in the other direction.Dune Part 2 continued the same awe-inspiring cinematography and breath-taking visual effects. However, its sometimes-mundane script and pedestrian storyline was held together by a superior, solid acting and editing. The costuming was, for the most part, magnificent. However, in a couple of battle scenes, the nearly identical battle garb made it very difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys. But the scenes of the good guys riding atop the gigantic desert worms was absolutely thrilling! Wound I recommend watching Dune Part 2? Absolutely.",positive
99,"Overall, much better than Dune: Part 1. Most of the actors were well cast and they acted well. The visuals were fantastic and it really made the world come alive. Paul was believable and Jessica is perfect- really no complaints with the main actors, except Chani. Sadly, they ruined Chani's character. In the books, she is Paul's primary supporter and she grounds him. Here, Chani is abrasive and antagonizes him. It was extremely annoying watching this extremely important character be butchered by Zendaya. Hopefully she is redeemed in the next iteration, but even if she is, the film and series is hurt by this baffling direction.",positive
100,"Dune Part Two: Interestingly CompellingReligion can be a controversial topic, some (like me) believe in it, and others do not. With so many people believing different things, and so many religions in the world, it can be hard to make a movie around this topic. It is not impossible however, since other shows have done it, such as His Dark Materials, Lucifer, and Dune. Dune Part One and Two is directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya from Spiderman the Homecoming Trilogy.Paul Atreides (Chalamet) is now with the Fremen people, trying to fulfill the prophecy. Paul also wants revenge on Baron Harkonnen, who killed his father. Meanwhile, the Harkonnens want to take over the desert (Arrakis) from the Fremen.Dune Part Two is a movie with lots of action, people riding cool creatures, and has incredible acting. What makes this movie so compelling is the religious aspect. Chalamet is compelling when portraying Paul, someone who at first did not believe the prophecy, but soon learns his purpose in life. From part one he grows into a good fighter, and someone who people wanted to follow. Zendaya portrays Chani, one of the Fremen people. By the end, I felt bad for her since she was alone. However, she stuck to her beliefs, even when everyone else decided to go in a different direction. Zendaya does an excellent job at playing someone that does not believe in the prophecy but cares about Paul. I enjoy seeing Zendaya expand her horizons, going from a love interest in a superhero movie, to a love interest and a strong warrior in a drama. Rebecca Ferguson played Paul's mother (Lady Jessica), who was the first one who wanted her son to fulfill the prophecy. She is a part of the Bene Gesserit (a religious sisterhood). Her main goal is to train her son to become who she thinks he will be. Austin Butler is the nephew of the guy in charge of house Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha likes to kill people for fun and is a good fighter. The relationship between the two houses (Atreides and Harkonnens) is complicated, which makes the audience want to know what is going to happen.Unfortunately, no one taught me anything about religion when I was younger. My first Introduction to it was watching the show Lucifer (which I think is sad). This is why I think making movies with religious meaning behind them is a wonderful thing to do. I have had a hard year (with death and sickness in my family), and religion has somehow become a topic I like to discuss. Therefore, this is why I found Dune Part Two better than Part One, the religious aspect made the movie more interesting and compelling to watch.",positive
101,"I've read reviews saying it's one of the best sci-fi films of all time. The only explanation for this is that people haven't been following the Children of Dune miniseries. When we have followed this beautiful series, we cannot really be amazed by these two films by Denis Villeneuve. Obviously, technically these films are splendid (very impressive visually, it's well written and the fight between Paul and Feyd was well thought out.) - it's Denis Villeneuve, all the same. But even if I have not read the original work of Frank Herbert, it seems to me that it is the real problem with any cinematographic adaptation of this saga. The original work lacks conceptual depth and is too predictable. To have a truly interesting Dune film, we would have to take more liberties with the original work which is too old. In this work, there is misogyny (Paul who takes a woman without even caring what she thinks), a lot of deus ex machina, a lack of seriousness (the harkonnen are supposed to be a big threat, but when we look at their leader and Beast Rabban...), etc. Besides, it is unjustifiable that Paul is forced to marry the famous girl.In addition, these two films have a real major flaw: the main actor. T. Chalamet doesn't have what it takes to play a character who is a great fighter and a leader of a nation. He is too puny, he does not have the build of a fighter (for example, Channing Tatum at the same age as him had the charisma for this type of character).Brief ! This saga is yet another demonstration that people's overall level of discernment is in serious trouble.",positive
102,"Dune 2 is, in my opinion, what modern science fiction and fantasy need. It is a phenomenally shot film with amazing performance from Timoth√©e Chalamet and zendaya. The story is interesting and kept me engaged the whole 2 hours and 46 minute runtime. All that and an absolutely breathtaking soundtrack thanks to hans zimmer. My only issue with the film was that, in my opinion, the pacing was a bit off. A friend of mine who has read the books was a little bit dissapointed in the film, according to him the books go more into deatail about some caracters backstory and overall weaves a much more interesting story, but i am not reviewing the book, and he's not reviewing the movie, and i think that as a stand alone film, it is a masterpiece.",positive
103,"Denis Villeneuve's second half of his adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that Herbert was exploring around power, cults of personality, and leadership. He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts.",positive
104,"Where do I bring, well this movie is not good. Everyone heaping praise on it must be drunk or so starved for anything that looks good that they'll just blindly nod and smile.It's slow and I don't mean regular slow, I mean Zak Snyder super slow. If you're going to make a movie three hours long, fill it will interesting characters a d good dialogue. Don't just fill it with scenes that add nothing to the story.Secondly, and this is my biggest gripe. Why do Timothee and Zendaya sounds the like they're a couple of Californian kids there for spring break. Paul's mum doesn't even bother hiding her British accent, Javier is the only one putting in any effort to sound like an indigenous population.Plot holes, so many plot holes. In the beginning Paul's mum magically transports to kill someone about to kill Paul, how?The freemen attack the harkonnen and no the ship has guns, Zendaya has a gun but everyone else sword fights for some reason.Paul rides a worm, worm could at any moment dive deep and the rider is dead. This is some of the stupidest writing I have ever read.Chemistry, Zendaya and Timothee don't have anyVisuals, amazing the movie looks incredible which is why I imagine everyone is gushing over it.I never write review but this movie annoyed me so much I had to vent. Please stop praising terrible movies because we'll keep getting terrible movies.",positive
105,"Dune: Part Two is about Paul Atreides's self-doubt of himself being the Messiah of Fremen and his desire to take revenge on his Father's murder and extermination of his house, contrary to his father's view on revenge.This movie dwelled mostly on Paul exploring whether he needed to be the Messiah of the Fremen or not, but that made his revolt plot against the emperor look underwhelming. Chani loves and helps Paul for his dedication to knowing the ways of Fremen but she envies him that he is the Messiah as most Fremen expect to be. That's a contradiction to be within one character. Feyd-Rautha tried to be badass in his introduction scene, but it failed instead making him look like a puny who thinks of himself as badass. There is no weight in this character: The Worst Villain portrayal.Now, I am interested and delved into what Paul will do to the Bene Gesserit for the game they played with his houses and turning other houses against him in the name of Prophecies. As they are the actual villains, convincing the emperor to slay the House Atredies. They are getting ready to accept and adapt themselves to whoever will win the emperor. By marrying the emperor's daughter to a new emperor, they will make sure that they exist after the Holy War.As the movie is slow-paced while watching for the first time I paid full attention without getting bored, but the second time I got bored mostly, especially with the scenes I felt as drawbacks.The actors did a great job, especially Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya. The director built the world amazingly. He focused more on how Paul Atreides evolved in the dilemma of being a Messiah or being a part of Fremen's revolution. The cinematography was good as it captured the dune desert in a stunning way and amazing shots on the Worm riding scenes. Dialogues and giving meaning to characters' names as the prophecy describes them were a good touch to the movie. The music and Sound effects were great and not more or less than the scenes required.Overall my opinion is that it's a good movie but with some flaws as I mentioned and it had more story and character depth than Dune: Part One. I would definitely recommend this movie. If you enjoy the movies in which the story happens in a completely fictional world or universe, then you'll enjoy this movie and its prequel.I know nothing about the book, these are my thoughts just on the movie.",positive
106,"Denis Villeneuve continues to provide strong direction, writing and atmospheres throughout this movie as Villeneuve perfectly captures the characters, essence and themes of Dune. The camerawork, the visuals, the colors and production designs are all fantastic as it helped create the world and settings within the characters and tone. Various scenes of action, thrills, and tension were all well-executed and done beautifully. With many all-star cast members, all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of place.Since I haven't read the original book yet, I may not be too familiar with the lore of Dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts, characters and themes explored are pretty good. Including a great soundtrack, uses of dialogue and structures throughout. I honestly don't have any complaints about this one because I was enthralled with the entire movie.Overall, Dune: Part Two is a great continuation of the first film and Villeneuve has proven to be one of the best filmmakers we have right now.",positive

108,"Just got out of an early screening in IMAX 70mm and it was amazing. The visuals and CGI in this film were excellent and it was cinematographically better than Dune Part 1 even. A lot happens in this movie story-wise and the pacing was very good. Denis Villeneuve uses beautiful filmmaking techniques and the end result is just stunning. The contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audience's mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense. There are many twists/surprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly. I never felt bored in this movie. The action scenes and the sword/knife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see. This movie was much better than Dune Part 1 in terms of story, cinematography, CGI, and everything else, and this movie definitely sets up Dune 3 in a perfect way. Overall, the movie was fantastic, a must-watch, and I HIGHLY recommend watching it in IMAX.",positive

This has seriously set the standard for Hollywood quality! Denis best get the Best Achievement in Directing for this effort; he has MORE than earned it here! Such an astounding achievement overall! For me, it was a perfect film; it has everything you want in a film: good story, intriguing characters, touching drama, exciting action; seriously, this film has it all!!! Go out, treat yourself to the, and I'm gonna say it, the BEST FILM OF 2024!!!",positive
111,"So dissapointed I was, I seriously thought of leaving half way through. At times it progressed very slow, then it started to rush too much, some scenes were cringe and badly written (for instance Drax's big revenge moment), Paul and his mother suddenly seemed to turn evil without much explanation. I found it to be incosistent and incoherent..a bit boring (mind you i am a huge fan of the genre and I thought Timothy and Zendaya were great). It gets a 7 from me only for the cgi, video editing etc & the cool worm riding moments (best thing about this movie) and awesome cast. Btw, dis anyone else notice how pointless the fight scenes were? There was no tension, Paul and the freemen had the upperhand each time, hands down..",positive
112,"Dune is one of my favourite ever books for the last 30 years and I was super excited to see Villeneuve's adaptation. Contrary to most people, I quite liked the 1984 David Lynch movie, but expected this to be a massive step forward. Sadly, like most of Villeneuve's movies, it is all style no substance.The visuals are beautiful. It is one of the most aesthetically appealing movies I have ever seen. Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. The cast is A-lister from start to finish, but too many of them have been cast because they are famous rather than because they fit the character (ie Christopher Walken as the emperor). The plot wanders away from the book quite a bit, and ignores any real character development.Overall, the movie left me cold. It looks great, sounds great, but I just didn't care. I wish I had taken the 6 hours from watching the two movies and read the book again instead.",positive
113,"I gave this mess of a film 4 stars simply on the weight of the special effects and cinematography. The worm riding was the best part of the film. The interaction between the main characters are shallow and most often miss the main themes of the source material.And why did tge director change one of the main plot points? Paul's sister Alia is born early with all the Bene Gesserit powers. She kills Vladimir Harkonin, not Paul. This completely changes the story line, and not in a good way.I thought the first movie was a snooze fest, but kept telling myself ""just wait until Part 2 when all the action happens. "" Was I wrong.I will never trust Denis Villeneuve again.",positive
114,"This movie is def in my top ten movies of all time with Dune part one as well. Timothee's acting was superb. The cinematography was beautiful, the directing was great and the music was powerful. I also love Javier as Stilgar and Zendaya as Chani, both great performances. I havent read the book so im not sure how it differs but I did see the first movie and the limited series...you just cant beat this version. I dont think anything will top this movie this year and I cant wait for Messiah.It really is hard to put into words the brilliance of this film. All I can say is you NEED to see it right now.",positive
115,"Rating: 9.5/10
Watched on Feb 25th, 2024 @ Fan First Premiere event
Format: (Digital) IMAXIt's safe to say that Dune Part 2 is basically an expansion of Part One. More characters are added, the story is now more complex and 10x interesting with much going on, and the world of Dune is bigger.However, with lots of negativities in my opinion, the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the rating.Director Denis Villeneuve proves himself again in Part Two that he is the perfect director to direct the Dune project. In addition, all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be delivered.The VFX in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all. Also, the cinematography that captures Arrakis (where most of the film is held in) absolutely supports the VFX in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert. Moreover, most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the character.The film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language, clothings, production design, movements, and all the beliefs that most of the characters follow.Hans Zimmer's music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences, there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibe.Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya are absolutely amazing. Paul Atreides (played by Timoth√©e Chalamet) have reached his peak and prime level. By the end of this film, he is no longer the young Paul Atreides, he is the most powerful man in Arrakis and no one can top him nor control him. He is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in Part One and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasn't that easy. And this might be one of the greatest character studies/character development stories in cinema history, and Timoth√©e Chalamet had a huge part in achieving that. By the end of Part Two, you will realize that Chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray Paul Atreides due to Chalamet's deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters. However, the real surprise is Rebecca Ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to Rebecca's acting. She was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character Jessica. The second biggest surprise is Austin Butler as Fyed-Rautha as both his make-up design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the book.For the negativities:-With the same mistake that is in Dune Part One, Part Two (and the whole Dune saga) highly needs to be 'Rated R' to allow some gore, bloody, and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film, and part Two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with Austin Butler's character, Feyd-Rautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in Black & White and I think it's obvious the reason behind shooting them in Black & White.-Unfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly. Especially with Javier Bardem's character Stilgar that cracks most of the jokes. What happened to Stolgar that walked in on Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atredius in Part One with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his people?Also, Dave Batista's character Glossu Rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with Batista's physical appearance nor the character's characteristics or the 'brutal' House Harkonnen that he represents.-(NOT A SPOILER AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE)
Lastly, in case you didn't know, during the London premiere of Dune Part Two, actress Anya Taylor-Joy appeared at the red carpet and it was announced that the actress will be having a small surprise appearance role in the film. Can I understand why this was announced and why wasn't it kept as a surprise like it was this whole time????? Since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere? This makes her appearance at the carpet very much useless and it truly ruined the surprise that was kept hidden perfectly the past few years.",positive
116,"Really enjoyed this second installment of Dune. It feels mostly true to the book with a couple notable exceptions. The book does not paint Chani as being in opposition to Paul - she is with the program the whole way and even understands why Paul must take Irulan to wife rather than her. Also, it is Alia who kills Baron Harkonnen with a gom jabbar, not Paul with a knife.Other than these two plot diversions, the movie kept my interest and the pacing was fine. A bit slow at the beginning but speeding up as the movie went along right up to the final scene. At the end I wanted more. Hopefully Dune 3 will explore both Children of Dune and Dune Messiah. The special effects were first rate. Again, all in all an enjoyable movie.",positive
117,"I think that watching this film in a regular theatre or on TV must be a very different experience than what I had watching it in IMAX, in fact I've only ever seen Dune (both parts) in IMAX, so I can't really judge the movie in any other format. However, the crushing sense of scale is so important for the feeling you get from this (and the previous entry) that I really can't imagine the same effect from watching it on your phone or something. So, do see it on the largest, loudest screen you can find.With that out of the way let's get to the film proper. At nearly 3 hours long, I could have easily sat on my chair for double that time and still not be bored. The second instalment of Dune is a miracle in several ways, a miracle of special effects, set and costume design and of storytelling, that manages to make a famously unwieldy story perfectly easy to parse, but it is above all a miracle of pacing. There isn't a second of boredom or a low point in the movie, it's an epic in the true sense of the term, you spend half the time crushed by scale and the other half lost in the details of the movie.Managing to tell a complex political tale with a surprisingly small amount of dialogue or exposition, the film also makes several very smart changes to the book which I really want to see pay off in the third movie (there will be one, as this ends in a cliffhanger). In terms of acting everyone is pretty good, but the addition of Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the real standout here. Florence Pugh is promising but has a limited role, which if this is anything like the books will be greatly extended in the third movie. A real masterpiece.",positive
118,"With David Lynch's dune being over the span of 2 hours covering the course of the entire dune book, causing very large pacing issues, and Jodorowsky's Dune never being made due to production issues planned to be 14 hours long. With the first two Dune adaptations (one not releasing) having length issues, one being long and the other being too short, the adaptation of Dune by Denis Villenueve took a different approach by splitting the book in half. With the first coming out part one being phenomenal and a near perfect sic-fi epic with a perfect pacing. Each individual plot event feels impactful and heavy. The lack of time constraints on part 1 made the movie able to convey its story with weight, allowing for a very immersive and enjoyable experience. However, because Denis Villenueve decided to split the book in half when adapting it to the big screen, a large portion of the story was left for one singular movie. The compression of all the events in the 2nd film lead to a very fast paced movie. Dune part 2 massively suffers from this extremely fast pacing as each event that should be absolutely epic and meant to leave you in awe instead make you overwhelmed and thus makes the exciting events much less epic. The film is absolutely fantastic. As anybody who read the book knows, the book is split into 3 main parts. I believe it would've been perfect if it were to be a Dune trilogy instead. Dune part 2 is henna sci-fi epicness, but I simply cannot give it a 10/10 due to its extremely fast pacing. By squishing all of the awesome events into one movie a lot of the moments that left you in awe from the part 1 are quite lost for me. Still amazing and if you ever see this movie getting a rerelease in theaters for when Dune: Messiah releases (or the miniseries on max) I fully 100% recommend checking it out. If you love sci-fi and just want to watch an entertaining movie, I really do recommend Dune Part 2. I also should add to never watch this on a tiny screen. Do Frank Herbert's and Denis Villeneuve some justice and give it the big screen it deserves.",positive
119,"I think most the ppl who claim dune to be the masterpiece are not familiar with cinematography at all. Perhaps they are young generation ppl who missed real masterpieces of the past, when acting, dialogues and story telling were the most important aspects of the movie. Not just flashy special effects like we have nowadays in movie and music industry. I really liked the first part but it was still far from a masterpiece , the second part I rate even lower. Both are good and entertaining movies but acting and story telling is not there to even consider a good 8/10. The highest notes go to the scenography and music. Very well done.",positive
120,"This was an awesome movie clear up to the end and then the last 5 minutes was like a punch in the gut. I've read the book, and saw the original with Kyle McLaughlin and I just love this type of genre. I even published a few books myself, but the ending just did not satisfy me at all. Seems like there are a lot of remakes anymore and they usually end up, so so. To be fair, I love the actors, I love the way it was directed and overall the movie was well done, thank you! The cast and crew did an excellent job on this movie and I will watch it again. I was just disappointed in the ending. This movie deserves 10 Stars but in good conscience I can't do that. Just my humble opinion, that's all.",positive
121,"Disclaimer. I am in my 50s and have watched the original movie so I am a bit biased. I found the first movie gripping and visually astonishing. I thought it was an absolute masterpiece. I eagerly waited for the second installment of the Dune Saga. Having watched the second movie, I cannot escape the feeling of disappointment. The movie again is a technical master, visual effect the sound, the imagery. What you perceive is fantastic!! Is no doubt technical masterpiece. But I feel compared to the first movie that the timeframe has changed and that the storyline altered. Some elements like the ""weirding-way"" of battle were totally missing. Also , the romance between Chani and Paul was very abruptly ended. It actually didn't make any sense.Bearing in mind that there will be a third movie, or rather that there might be a third movie, will still watch that and make up my mind when I have seen all three. Sincerely hope that the third part will close the story circle as it should. Had they not seen the original one, had I not need familiar with the story, I would definitely rate this higher because honestly it is a feast for the eyes...",positive
122,"THE 2 FILMS ARE... just OK.Public sentiment is against me but here goes why.Pluses: great FX, plot follows the trilogy, all the big cinematic boxes are ticked, fair pacing (more on that later), some characters are well played.Negatives: waaaay over-acted and I felt like I was watching a 40's B movie, antagonists far too obvious and shallow, Paul was borderline good at best, the battles were poorly choreographed - a lot of slashing and posturing reminiscent of ""300"" and that's not a compliment - the whole dreaming and mind talking thing wasn't impactful enough, Christopher Walken is one of my favorite actors but this time he was flat - maybe he was poorly directed? - pacing was too slow with lots of walking and walking and climbing and sand dancing - cutting all that out would've saved a least a half hour of screen time and it felt like filler to me.Yeah it did huge box office but to me that's more of an indicator of the general dumbing down of society at large, and less (a lot less) than it being a great film.",positive
123,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, given the great story and masterful execution. There were some changes from the books, but they were modest in scope and actually seemed like smart decisions -- that's kind of amazing all by itself.Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Charlotte Rampling, L√©a Seydoux, and IMHO even Christopher Walken were all well-chosen for their roles. I appreciate good casting.I happen to have read the books, which I thought were so-so (unlike my friends), so I don't understand the reviews whining about the movie being disappointing. The story and specific effects are top-notch. The experience is highly immersive. What else do you need?I give this seven stars, plus a one-star bonus for the excellent adaption, a half-star bonus for the perfect pacing, and quarter-star bonuses for Javier Bardem and Florence Pugh*, whose performances I particularly enjoyed. That's nine (9) stars total.* She didn't get much screen time, true, but I thought she was great. She seemed a tiny bit awkward and/or uncomfortable, which (for me) is just part of her realism and stage presence. Oh, what complexities must lie hidden beneath the surface.",positive
124,"A fan of Dune should absolutely read the books. The rich tapestry of details and stories present in the novels are often missing or condensed in the film adaptations. The depth of world-building and character development in Frank Herbert's work transports readers to an expansive and immersive universe that the movies can only hint at.However, my current rating of the Dune movie takes into account the overall quality of films released in recent years. Compared to the many lackluster movies that have flooded the market, Dune stands out for its ambition, visual splendor, and attempt to faithfully capture the essence of Herbert's vision, even if it inevitably falls short of the book's depth.",neutral
125,"This movie, about Paul Atreides who unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family, is a masterpiece!Just what I expected; definitely better on a rewatch! I loved it after my first-time watch, but now I love it even more. Now I am obsessed with it and cannot wait for the next sequel. During my first-time watch, there were several elements that slightly detracted my experience, like the time jumps, small and confusing but important details, pacing, and the deal with antagonists. There are still a few minor issues that I still think could have been done better, but now that I am already aware of them, I really do not care. Only the positive elements are visible to me because the original issues I had with it make much more sense now and feel just right.I love the world introductions in Dune (2021), when we see everything for the first time. You just forget your own reality while being soaked into its fictional world. Once you have a good enough understanding and overview of the story and characters, the show goes on, especially in Dune: Part Two. The first movie is like a cold and dark introduction, but the second movie is more of a powerful and dangerous soul. The line by the father, Duke Leto Atreides, of the protagonist, Paul Atreides, ""A great man doesn't seek to lead; he is called to it."" is the perfect slogan for Dune: Part Two, and Dune: Part Two masterfully translates it into drama, action, and adventure. During my previous watch, I looked at the movie as more like the good versus the evil, but now my only focus is on Paul. Everything is about him himself. He is the one who moves the people. He is the one who makes a change for the world. My focus was too much on the antagonists during my first-time watch because I was disappointed with how easily they were defeated after a huge build-up, but now I see that part as a strengthening element to the depiction of Paul as Lisan al Gaib. The weaknesses of the antagonists make Paul so much more powerful, and I love it!In terms of the technical aspects, they are probably the best ones I have ever experienced. They are not perfect, but you cannot get much better quality in 2024. Dune: Part Two has everything; cinematography, sound, score, CGI, practical effects, locations, costumes, makeup, props. It is mind-blowing. It is probably the best movie theater experience I have ever had, especially because of its technical aspects, which does not only make it to a fantastic movie, but an actual unforgettable experience, and I am grateful for that. Long live the cinema!This movie surpasses its predecessor. The intricate world, allows the story to truly flourish. Paul emerges as the central focus, a leader not by choice but by destiny. The movie masterfully translates this theme into a thrilling spectacle, complete with unparalleled technical achievements. It is not only a good versus evil story, but a character study of the power and purpose of Paul. The experience is unforgettable, a testament to the magic of cinema.",positive
126,"This movie was phenomenal! The cinematography was beautifully, the cgi was incredibly impressive, and the acting was amazing! It directly follows up the first movie and keeps the same pacing, while also adding more elements of action, comedy, and heart. My only complaint is that some of the transitions felt a bit abrupt but besides that it was the perfect movie! This is a must see in IMAX, it just completed the whole experience for me. Hollywood knows what they are doing with this franchise, I can only hope they get their act together and start to make more movies of this same quality. Absolutely loved it!",positive
127,"This is the Lord of the Rings movie that people my age missed out on. This was a passion project for Denis Villenueve, and it shows.If you're looking for a casual movie experience that is easy to digest, this is not the movie for you. This movie, just like the first one, doesn't spoon feed you anything. It requires attention and application to be fully appreciated. Luckily, it's a really easy movie to pay attention to because of how intense and epic it is.Some of the changes that were made from the book were a little disappointing to me, but they were clearly necessary and I could tell that they were made with love and a true and deep understanding of the source material. Making a book-accurate Alia had the potential to ruin the tone of the entire movie. Also, even though I think baby Leto's death would have packed a powerful punch and been helpful to inform Paul's choices, it was rendered impossible with the decision to condense the timeline. After watching it, I honestly don't think that it could have been done much better than it was.",positive
128,"An absolutely gorgeous, austere piece of film. Denis Villeneuve is serving up some of the most majestic of scientific fiction images we've seen on the 21st century cinema screen. It's impossible to say this a bad film or adaptation.Villeneuve treats each shot as if it were a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.Herbert's dense novel can be a daunting slog for the average reader, who can't tell a Sandworm from a Sardaukar - which is one of the reasons Villeneuve's approach felt like such a breakthrough: It pared the mythology down to something manageable, serving up visceral action set-pieces at regular intervals. The movie air-dropped audiences in a world where foreign customs, politics and technology had long been established, never letting the complexity of those elements slow down the storytelling.That's not to say Villeneuve's ""Dune"" movies are fast-paced. Channeling the austerity of Andrei Tarkovsky at times, the director takes nearly five hours to cover what David Lynch did in just slightly more than two (though iconic in some respects, the now badly dated 1984 version barely scratched the surface of Herbert's concerns). If ""Part Two"" feels slow in places, it's because Villeneuve takes time to develop the connection between characters, as in a handful of scenes dedicated to Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) and Paul, aka Muad'Dib (or Usul), whose undeniable attraction doesn't align with Jessica's plans for her son.In many ways overcomes some of the weakness of the first (pacing overall felt better, obviously less setup, the score is used more sparingly in a way that allows many more moments breathe). But still suffers from the necessity of cramming so much story into such a small space. Some beats that need to feel pivotal, felt rushed to me and there's not much room for character performance to do the heavy lifting. You hardly notice though because you're inside a such stunningly realized alien landscape for the length, with so much to look at and take in. I enjoyed every moment and can't wait to revisit it soon.Audience will find in Villeneuve's multipart saga a satisfaction few films can offer. It's an enormous gamble, given the expense of creating at this scale, and a vote of confidence in cinema, which still hasn't recovered to the pre-pandemic level at play when the franchise was conceived. The fate of far more than Arrakis is riding on ""Dune.""",positive
129,"I didn't like the first movie much besides the production it had, i liked the concept and mood of the story.I was expecting this one to be better. It wasn't
The characters are simple and naive. The story isn't deep.They try to talk about religion but not be straightforward with it while they clearly and directly use their phrases and some of their ideology, and change few staff to not make the religion or people look bad.They don't talk directly about the economy, moral implications, race, gender, physic of the world, biology, and science of tech they use, which is missing opportunity.There wasn't much of new design choices
Location that feel different
90% of The First 2 act was boring, but the 3rd one wasn't bad, maybe even enjoyable, which wasn't the case for the other 2 act.",negative
130,"Dune is an increbdile film with amazing visuals. I was shocked at how good the movie turned out.The first Dune movie got me confused, because the storyline was a bit complicated.But i watched the movie a second time and after that i fell in love with it.Denis Villenueve brought an amazing movie to life with its unbelievable Visuals and characters.It draws you under its spell and you can not get enough of it.I would want to watch it again and again.The new characters are good choosen and bring a new depth to the movie.

131,"Dune Part 2 is a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve's direction, Greig Fraser's Cinematography, Hans Zimmer's music and marvelous acts by each and every member of the starcast makes this one of the best movies ever made. Put Denis, Greig, Hans, Tim and Austin already as nominees for the Oscar. You can feel that everyone from the team has given their best. This literally was the best cinematic experience I had after Interstellar. I don't think that any film releasing this year will be able to even match this one. I Was lucky enough to catch a fan premiere in IMAX today. Also, the IMAX experience is worth it.",positive
132,"I liked Dune part 1 better than this sequel.. Its visuals were better and the story and acting were good to at least half decent...It sparked enough interest in me to at least want to see More...I was hoping to see the Guild navigators and the Folding of Space!..Part 2 here almost had me snoozing off mid movie...The acting was weak and wooden and Unconvincing from the principle characters,especially Timothy and the woman playing his mother.... Ive seen the original Dune movie from the 80's , many times and frankly, it blows the current away as far as creating a surreal
world and drawing you in with fascinating characters..Even the old by todays standards, effects and cinematography were levels above the big budget attempts of the current movie...This one today, feels effects laden, but devoid of soul, that essense that was captured in the original so well... I also really like the children of Dune series, its characters surpassing the interest I found in the current story here... to each his own..Its visually very good but visuals alone do not make a story hold the interest of the viewer.. that takes good writing and compelling acting, qualities absent in this movie.",positive
133,"Lawrence of Arabia without the depth.The pacing was the problem. It was far too slow for the first 3/4 then rushed at the end. It meandered with little sense of what the point was at times.Chalamet just became a megalomaniac quite abruptly with very little development. And there was no surprise that he was going to become a messiah. His big challenge of riding a sand worm - ""the biggest ever seen"" (of course) - was predictably successfulWhy was Jessica chosen to be the Fremen mother superior when outsiders were so distrusted?Too little explanation, even though there was plenty of time to do so.Baron Harkonnen became quite ineffectual.The Emperor was just a feeble old man. Where did his power come from? His fighters seemed quite average. He landed on the Arakkis and was defeated easily.I enjoyed Part 1 more because the characters were fresh and were more engaging. In Part 2 they seemed a little empty and caricatured. Part 2 seemed more of a grind.The exploration of religion, fanaticism, freedom fighting vs terrorism, was interesting and unusual for a sci-fi movie. It does stand head and shoulders above most blockbusters.Of course, the visuals were stunning, as was the teeth-rattling sound.Although I admire the Director's more measured approach, i.e. Not just churning out a sequel, I'm not sure I'm excited enough for a part 3.ADDENDUM:
On reflection I am even less impressed by this movie. The pacing would have been ok - I thought it was ok at the time - EXCEPT it was all ruined by the last 30 mins.The big climactic fight is a dud. The soldiers waving their teeny swords at the sand worms is ludicrous. Why all the sword fights when lasers and machine guns have been used earlier? Paul just marches into the Emperor's super-tech ship. The guards are impotent. The suddenly pathetic Harkonnen is just stabbed. The Emperor looks bewildered and tired. The big knife fight is predictable and quite pointless.And then ... Paul sends his ragtag Taliban desert warriors, who have never been off-planet, off to fight space armies in part 3. But I guess if they're all as ineffectual as the Emperor and his elite guard and the entire Harkonnen clan, then I'm sure they'll do just fine.I won't be watching.",positive

So there was nothing that was done any worse, I just liked the character development in Part 1 and how they set everything up.It's beautifully shot and the cinematography is incredible. Also how it implements sound, and silence, to sculpt the atmosphere is awesome too. The special effects I thought were insane too, just with the scope of the machines, sandworms, explosions, and the angles they used.This is a must-see if you're a sci-fi fan (obviously watch Part 1 first).",neutral

Zendaya's role as Chani is significantly expanded, and she brings a fierce determination and depth to the character. The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Javier Bardem, continues to impress, with standout performances from Stellan Skarsg√•rd as the menacing Baron Harkonnen and Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan.Story and Adaptation
Villeneuve's adaptation stays true to the spirit of Herbert's novel while making necessary adjustments for cinematic storytelling. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the complex narrative and rich world-building to unfold organically. Key plot points, such as Paul's prophetic visions, the political intrigue, and the rising rebellion of the Fremen, are handled with care and clarity.Soundtrack and Sound Design
Hans Zimmer's score for ""Dune: Part Two"" elevates the film's epic scale, blending haunting melodies with powerful orchestral pieces that underscore the emotional and dramatic beats of the story. The sound design immerses the audience in the world of Arrakis, from the eerie whispers of the Bene Gesserit to the thunderous roars of the sandworms.Themes and Impact
""Dune: Part Two"" explores themes of destiny, power, and survival with a depth that resonates. The film delves into the philosophical and ethical dilemmas faced by its characters, particularly Paul, as he grapples with his role as the potential savior and destroyer. The environmental and colonial themes are also more pronounced, reflecting the novel's relevance to contemporary issues.Conclusion

137,"All the complaints about short fight scenes and characters not getting proper shine, or plots not explained are foolishness . The reason this movie is so significant is because it wasn't scared to tell a story in an untraditional way. I find it funny that everyone says "" it's much better than the first, I hated the first movie it was too slow"" . So why the heck did you watch the second movie? Seems like most people feel this movie directly threatened Star Wars so they chose to pick sides no matter what brilliance they watched. Part of what makes Dune so unique is the fact that they don't explain every little thing to you like you were a child. But most people like their hands held . We need more movies like this and less movies from Disney/Marvel/Starwars with predictable outcomes and setups we have seen for decades. Something fresh, real and not shot in a studio.",negative
138,"""Dune: Part Two"" delivers a breathtaking continuation of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction masterpiece. This installment expands upon the intricate world-building, character development, and thematic depth established in the first film, solidifying its place as a landmark achievement in modern cinema.Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is nothing short of spectacular. The stunning cinematography, combined with the awe-inspiring landscapes of Arrakis, creates a sense of scale and grandeur that immerses viewers in the epic scope of the story. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that every frame is a work of art, capturing the harsh beauty and otherworldly nature of the desert planet.The narrative picks up where the first film left off, following Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) as he embraces his destiny amidst political intrigue, betrayal, and the struggle for control over the spice-rich planet of Arrakis. Chalamet's performance is both nuanced and powerful, capturing Paul's transformation from a young nobleman to a leader of the Fremen.The supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from Zendaya as Chani, Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, and Javier Bardem as Stilgar. Their characters are given more depth and screen time, enriching the story and adding layers of complexity to the relationships and power dynamics at play.The film's pacing is well-balanced, blending intense action sequences with quieter, character-driven moments. The epic battles and intricate political machinations are thrilling, while the exploration of themes such as destiny, loyalty, and survival adds emotional weight to the narrative.Hans Zimmer's evocative score complements the film's visuals perfectly, enhancing the sense of wonder and tension throughout the story. The music underscores key moments with a haunting, otherworldly quality that lingers long after the credits roll.While ""Dune: Part Two"" is a remarkable achievement, it is not without minor flaws. Some viewers may find the dense mythology and complex plot challenging to follow, particularly if they are not familiar with the source material. Additionally, the film's focus on world-building and thematic exploration occasionally comes at the expense of character development for some secondary characters.Despite these minor issues, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation that elevates the epic saga to new heights. It honors the legacy of Herbert's novel while delivering a cinematic experience that is both visually stunning and intellectually engaging.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a triumph of filmmaking that solidifies Denis Villeneuve's adaptation as a definitive version of the classic story. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling performances, and rich thematic depth, it stands as a monumental achievement in the science fiction genre and a must-see for fans of the epic saga.",neutral
139,"Dune is very close to the category of masterpiece. Specialists in the field such as Steven Spielberg or Christopher Nolan have already said it and hey will not put their credibility at stake.I have read that there are various fandoms of much simpler universes with less talented creators who are condemning the film simply out of resentment. Or simply people without artistic sensitivity.You can deny it. If you watched in the cinema, when you got up from your seat, you felt like you've just come from an exciting ride on a sandworm. All my senses were excited. Dune 2 is a delight in every department, and Timoth√©e's transformation in this film is something we haven't seen from him yet. The strength, the range of variety and scope really surprised me. Austin Butler steals the show, and establishes himself as a solid actor in the industry. Rebecca Ferguson shows that she is at her peak. And DennisVilleneuve is established as one of the 5 directors of this century. In a single film, he manages to handle several rhythms to an almost perfect level. The last hour of the film is a scary adrenaline rush. The opening sequence is a feast for the eyes and the scene of Paul riding the Sandworm is magical.Dune 2 has revived epic sci-fi cinema.",neutral
140,"Dune part 1 was okay. Dune part 2 is better, but ultimately far more shallow. There's a lot more stuff that happens in part 2, but the core of the Dune story is lost.I liked the film. The film looks great. The CGI is great. It's paced well, and it's an enjoyable ride. The actors all do a good job. Big scenes, neat visuals and so on. It has an ""epic"" feel, but it's only skin-deep.There's barely any depth to the story you're seeing. Things/events obviously happen, but it's like it's a summary of a story rather than the story itself. There's zero tension or danger in the story - there are no stakes, no danger, no victory. The characters just do things but never seem to actually experience anything. There is no hardship, no loss, no vistory.There are no thrills, because there is no danger. There are no stakes because Paul (and the Fremen) never lose. There is no victory because the audience never feels like the good guys might lose. There is absolutely nothing thought-provoking in the slightest. There are no philosophical ideas (unlike the source novel).One review claims the film is ""thought-provoking"". Anyone who finds this film thought-provoking is literally braindead, and has never experienced actual thoughts. The same review claimed it was ""THRILLING"", using a scene where Dave Bautista escapes via a helicopter. I can tell you honestly that there were no thrills in that scene.Paul joins the Fremen, and then instantly becomes a military leader. Even his trial of living in the desert is skipped. He never experiences any trials or danger. Events just happen with no build-up. There is no emotional connection to anything happening.Unfortunately, it's ultimately all spectacle with no heart. The story is epic, the vistas epic, the everything is epic, except the story.",positive
141,"No doubt this movie is in its own class but the rush with storytelling made it difficult to enjoy all the details. The absolute best parts of this film are the several quiet moments, containing huge emotions and stopping the time before some world-changing events.But as was said, the movie contained a complex story which in some other cases would've been divided into two separate films. Some development happened so fast that the audience were still on the previous planet while the movie already jumped to the next one. I felt like I couldn't enjoy those Villeneuvishly spectacular scenes as much as they deserved to be enjoyed. A second round with this movie is definitely coming for me.",positive
142,"In the swirling sands of cinematic experimentation emerges ""Babel Babble,"" a visual odyssey through desert landscapes and digital dunes. While the cinematography and CGI are undeniably captivating, the story's coherence is as elusive as an oasis in the Sahara.Set against a backdrop of shifting sands and sun-bleached horizons, ""Babel Babble"" immerses viewers in a world where communication is as tangled as the desert undergrowth. Dialogue flits between languages like mirages on the horizon, leaving audiences to decipher a linguistic labyrinth with no map in sight.As the plot meanders through the dunes, viewers are left to wander alongside the protagonist, whose motivations are as inscrutable as the shifting sands beneath their feet. Attempts to unravel the narrative threads are met with frustration and confusion, as the story twists and turns like a sandstorm in the desert.Yet, amidst the narrative quagmire, ""Babel Babble"" shines as a visual spectacle. Each scene is a testament to the beauty of the desert landscape, from the golden hues of sunrise to the eerie glow of moonlit sand dunes. The CGI seamlessly blends reality and fantasy, creating vistas that are both breathtaking and surreal.In the end, ""Babel Babble"" is a film of contradictions. While its visuals transport viewers to stunning desert vistas, its story leaves much to be desired. It's a cinematic journey best enjoyed with a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to embrace the absurdity of it all. So strap in, hold on tight, and prepare to be whisked away on a whirlwind tour of linguistic chaos and visual splendor. Just don't expect to find much coherence along the way.",positive
143,"It is a very-very spectacular movie and contains many details from the book, still ... many important details were changed by the director.Don't see why he made Chani so faithless and skeptic, why Alia hasn't born untill the emperor has been defeated, where is Thufir (mentat).Liet's gender is a problem only if you know the fremen's society. The leader is always a man ... and Liet was the secret leader of the fremens before Paul.Also ... when Paul drank from the Water of Life, it wasn't Chani who ""saved"" him. In the book Paul neutralizes the poison on his own, but needed a Reverend Mother to find the place where even the Reverend Mothers could not go ...As a movie, it is spectacular and good.As a Dune movie it is not that good.",positive
144,"This isn't Dune. Events, characters are missing or changed for the worse. The plot is dumbed down really hard. Dialogues are on the level of children.Not-Chani and Not-Paul don't have any chemistry together and they behave out of character just like most of the cast.Major plot points were left out or changed which makes this a bad movie. Having nice visuals is not enough, you got to have a good script too.It is disrespectful the call this visual diarrhea a Dune movie. Even the 1984 version was better, not to mention the 2000's mini series. You might as well watch an AI generated garbage.",positive
145,"The cinematography is really good and there's moments of the movie where you feel like you're in it. The action scenes are way better in this one as well as the storyline. However there are still some moments that don't keep you tuned in.This film does provide more backstory about characters
Austin Butler did a great job and deserved more screen time.Timothee's delivery as a menacing character could be better but still decent.The sound track is pretty nice and keeps you awake through a lengthy film as Dune.Some aspects are predictable but it doesn't take away from the film.Overall it is a great movie with great acting.",positive
146,"I watched Dune 2 expecting a continuation of the interesting first part, but I left the theater in awe and noticed others leaving equally mesmerized and amazed. The film is a masterpiece. Visually stunning, with a compelling story featuring well-developed characters and excellent performances.While the first film follows the ""hero's journey"" as we all know it, it left a taste of ""more of the same."" Dune 2, on the other hand, while still using this storytelling method, twists it in a way that washes away the slight taste of clich√© from the first film. And the director executes this spectacularly. It's a ""must-watch"" for any sci-fi fan and undoubtedly one of the best in the genre of all time.Today, I was impressed in the best possible way. What a happy day.",positive
147,"Dune part two is a very good movie. It is a masterpiece in terms of visuals, stage designs, use of sound, acting, and the subtext it adapts from the book. It is perhaps the best movie that Hollywood has offered us in recent years, made by the most qualified people. But there is some flaws, even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around. Still, I can also say that it is the most deserved hype I have ever seen.The film has two major issue that are related to each other. The first is that the ending of the film is rushed, as if the budget or screen time has run out. The film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment. Thus, the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless. It's a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones here, there is a pacing problem. Honestly, I suspect this feeling was because I was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so I went crazy for seeing more and more.The second problem is Alia. I understand the difficulty of staging Alia. That's why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mother's womb throughout the movie. This is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie, which is smooth except for the last act. While what we see from Paul's and Jessica's experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline, this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six months.It's a problem that shouldn't even be mentioned, but the fact that the Fremen's battle uniforms did not resemble Paul's visions in the first movie made me a little bitter.Dune is a masterpiece in many senses, especially cinematographically. In fact, what the source story says about people, its subtexts and world fiction are amazing. I haven't been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time. I loved how they changed Chani's story arc and gave her a personality, and I loved how they showed Jessica's role more clearly than in the book. I loved how they made the character of Feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of things.So, it is not free from some flaws. Still, it is such a good movie that, while you normally get bored watching a movie over and over again, I love this movie even more by watching it over and over again.",positive
148,"As an avid enthusiast of photography and videography, the cinematic masterpiece that is DUNE Part 1 resonated deeply with me, captivating my heart with its breathtaking camera work. Each frame seemed to be meticulously crafted, transforming the screen into a canvas adorned with visually stunning art.I got really excited when I received an invite to see Dune Part 2 early. Not only was the camera work impressive, but the actors and the story were fantastic too, making it a memorable experience. While I won't say it's the best for everyone, I think it's pretty awesome. Everything, from how they filmed it to the sfx, the cast, and the story, felt almost perfect.",positive
149,"There's no question that this film has stunning special effects, excellent production values and some decent performances (Javier Bardem's crusty but devout Stilgar springs to mind). But the movie is so long! (nearly 3 hours). Whereas I admired the first film for its ability to describe the world of Dune with good economy, this film seemed overstuffed with events that were hard to understand if you weren't overly familiar with the book(s). In addition, to realize that all the events (Jessica influencing the Fremen, Paul learning the Fremen ways, sabatoging the Harkonnen's spiceworks, Paul becomes a Messianic figure, etc etc etc) all took place in less than nine months?! (How do we know? Jessica is pregnant at the beginning AND the end of the film). But if you want a film full of spectacle, this one definitely has that and, credit due, some of the scenes are breathtaking.",positive
150,"Denis Villeneuve's *Dune: Part Two* is a bold and divisive sequel that fully embraces the epic scale and moral complexity of Frank Herbert's original novel. It's a film that will undoubtedly provoke strong reactions, as it delves deep into the dark consequences of messianic prophecies and the destructive power of unchecked ambition.The film picks up where the first installment left off, with Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) embracing his role as the Muad'Dib. His powers grow exponentially, enabling him to manipulate sandworms, control minds, and predict the future. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and Paul's actions begin to have far-reaching and devastating consequences.The Fremen, under the leadership of Chani (Zendaya), become a formidable force under Paul's guidance, but their victory comes at a terrible cost. The holy war against the oppressive galactic empire, is unleashed, leading to unimaginable suffering and destruction.The film doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of Paul's character, as his thirst for power and control grows. His relationship with Chani becomes increasingly strained as he becomes consumed by his destiny. The performances from both Chalamet and Zendaya are exceptional, capturing the complexities of their characters with nuance and depth.The supporting cast delivers strong performances, with Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen standing out as a charismatic and ruthless villain. Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan is a complex figure, caught between loyalty to her family and a growing admiration for Paul.*Dune: Part Two* is even more stunning than its predecessor. The desert planet of Arrakis is brought to life with breathtaking detail, and the large-scale battle sequences are both thrilling and horrifying. Hans Zimmer's score continues to be a highlight, providing a powerful emotional backdrop to the story.However, the film's exploration of themes such as religion, ecology, and the dangers of unchecked power may be challenging for some viewers. The ending is particularly divisive, leaving a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty that will linger long after the credits roll.*Dune: Part Two* is a bold and uncompromising film that demands to be seen and discussed. It is a sequel that expands upon the world-building of the first film while also exploring the darker implications of its story. While it may not be for everyone, it is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement that will be remembered for years to come.",positive
151,"Being a long time fan of Dune, and the books by Frank Herbert, I left Dune: Part Two with a sense of confusion at what I had just watched.Denis Villeneuve did a phenomenal job with Dune: Part One, hands down, no question. He stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few, albeit minor changes from the novel. The reasons behind this were understandable; deliver Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienced.Dune: Part Two arrives; critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a ""masterclass of filmmaking"" and ""best science fiction movie of all time to date"".I am fair and give credit where credit is due. The characters and their execution of their roles were flawless, the cinematography was awe-inspiring, the action was jaw-dropping, and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectly.So, why six stars? The story. Hands down, the story.There are creative liberties taken by Villeneuve that I believe hurts the original material. Many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by ""holy crap!"" moments, and the *GASP* moments in the film. Granted, while, once again, masterfully executed, they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do - get shock value. Whether these changes were studio decisions, or Villeneuve's, remains to be seen.Had Villeneuve followed his original formula from Dune: Part One into Dune: Part Two, following the narrative from Frank Herbert's original works, I still think this film would have impressed beyond measure. Unfortunately, in its release state, I believe Dune: Part Two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is Dune - the story.This is how I felt leaving the theater; let down. Is it a visually stunning and well executed movie? Yes. Is it true to the source material? No.I leave viewers, enthusiasts, and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning. If you want to see an amazing movie, you will be pleased. If you are going for the story - be prepared.",positive
152,"First chapter was good, long prologue for something more. I was expect that Part Two will surprise me non-trivial story, great acting, beautiful cinematography and taking all of my attention, but... Miracle not happend. First 50 min was good, but next two hours I was watching absolutely bored and nonsense movie. This is was a real disappointment journey in nothing. Scene just replace each other there is have no sense, just a set of scenes. Here is some bald guy fight with some kind of people, then he going somewhere and kill another guys, and so it was for the next two hours, just someone going somewhere and do something. What for? Why? Who are all these people and why they fight? I just waste time, and the most annoying thing is I even didn't know about Third Chapter, and now I have to wait about 2-3 years for next chapter, I thought that Part Two will be final film, but it's not. Overall I just waste 3 hours while watching this nonsense movie. Only one thing I was really surprised it's performance by Javier Bardem. This is was amazing, I like it.5/10 for first half of this movie, rest is trash.",positive
153,"Admittedly, I was a big fan of the David Lynch version and prior to the release of Part 1 I was not expecting much. I am first to admit when I am wrong, and in the case I certainly was. Does it do the novel justice, probably not. But it is such an indepth and complicated setting that I am not sure it would be possible. Back to this, both parts taken as one movie really do make a good attempt at telling the story. The sound and feel for the environments, most of the acting and the special effects are high end. I was anticipating a modern 'reimagining' of the characters and plot and although there is a minor element, it actually adds to the movie.",positive
154,"No spoilers.But let me be clear my husband is the huge fan of dune, and the series of books. I've seen the Lynches OG. And I like Lynch but it didn't match up to the remake imo.So now I'll admit I'm not a fan of this genre, and while I did like the first, my husband loved it so I pre booked tickets to this one for a first viewing. I wasn't anywhere near as excited as him.But my god! I didn't want to look away, it's long at just under 3 hours but it didn't feel it. Not a single scene was needless or ""filler"". The sound was unbelievable the room shook as did the screen visibly at points! Brilliant. Loved every minute.",positive
155,"I wasn't expecting to have a religious experience, but I guess that's how those sorts of things happen. The book is near and dear to me and, regardless of the changes made from the book, 10/10 doesn't quite do it justice. Sure, I could knit-pick, but any issues I might have are more than made up for. Sometimes you can just feel the reverance and dedication an artist has for the craft and faithfully adapting a classic story. What a time to be alive. Faith in cinema restored completely. Zendaya's Chani, though she doesn't impact the narrative much, frames the thematic structure better than in the book and has a forceful presence and voice that can't be silenced. Chalamet effortlessly maneuvers between the quiet, reserved child of privilege and the crazed messiah willing and able to destory anything in his path. Javier Bardem brings the deep reverance, teacher, philosopher, and comic relief elements seemlessly. I don't know where to stop with the cast, so I'll just leave it there. The whole cast is wall-to-wall bullet proof. Absolute feast for the senses. Definitely see it in imax if you can. I could go on for days. Two thumbs up with a tear in the blue-within-blue eye. Thanks Denis. This made part one look like finger painting.",neutral
156,"Dune Part 2 as a film by itself was incredible. The vfx were amazing. The plot was really good. The acting was stellar. The cinematography. Everything was really well done.However, after about and hour and a half into the film, some major changes from the book started to become clear and egregious. As someone who read the book, I was quite disappointed by some of these changes.However, for anyone who has not read the book, this film should be an amazing experience and story.Despite my grievances, this movies was still incredible. I would recommend this film to those who read the book as well, just watch it expecting some relatively sizable changes. Really good movie, especially in theater. It was not, however, as good as the first film.",positive
157,"But now i have to.... Loved every 168 minutes of it and no, its not too long. Couple of scenes made me tear up just because they were so cool and epic. Yes its visual masterpiece but it is also so much more. It has heart and characters that you'll love. I laughed more than i thought i would, Javier Bardem was the biggest reason why. I was thinking that it has to slow down at some point it just kept going and building up towards to end. Packed with action and scenes that you find urself holding ur breath. I have one negative thing to say about Dune part 2 and its that i cant wait 3 years for that next one to come out.",positive
158,"Denis Villenueve you have earned my respect! You are a genius!Words simply cannot describe just how good Dune: Part Two is. Everything from the score, the visuals, the acting is a billion times better than Part One. You have a film that is able to deliverer on Action while also being a religious and political drama. My excitement of learning more about the world of Dune has simply elevated due to this film. Denis Villenueve has created an amazing sci fi entry worthy of joining the hall of fame of sequels! Simply one of the best films of the past years. If the next entry is able to be just as good if not better than this, we are looking at the next big saga in Cinema.This is what movies were made for!",positive
159,"I didnt read the book. I dont care about the book. This is a MOVIE, so forget about comparing the book to the movie and vice versa. Please!I didnt like Part One. It bored the heck out of me. It honestly did. I DO LIKE Part Two much better though, it's vibe is completely different (much more bleak and exciting). But it also has got it's flaws and BEWARE, you wont leave the cinema feeling all cheery and revived, because this sequel is quite a heavy mother...The bad: there is a limit to how long I can stand these contineous Hans Zimmer droning booming sounds. They just do not stop. There needs to be some BALANCE in the use of these bombastic sounds. A pause, a silence now and then only enhances the effect. Less is more...More bad: this movie's storyline is all over the place. It feels rushed at moments, confusing at other moments, some characters randomly appear and disappear. Everybody is (rightfully) complaining about this sequel being low on storyline.The good: Part Two has got a mean, vicious bleak spirit, with some really creapy bad guys. They really succeeded in making me being appalled by some of these mean characters. Great!More good: the action is quite dark and intrusive and mesmirising to watch. Almost hypnotizing action visuals.The really good stuff: the actors are simply sublime. They just dont come any better, although I personally do NOT like that they choose Timothee Chalamet for this character. I think he is just not suited for this role. But that is just my personal opinion...Visually it is terrific (as always with director Denis Villeneuve). Storywise it is kinda disappointing. Mixed bag. Certainly NOT worthy of 9 stars, that's simply ridiculous, but still worth a really enjoyable (heavy mother of a) watch nonetheless.Thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!",positive
160,"This was an incredible achievement in film. I was completely blown away by the cinematography, acting, writing, music and more. If it gets topped this year than it will be a legendary film in the history of movies. I only had a couple problems but it's not with the movie it's just that they took out the characters of Alia and Leto. In the book Alia kills the baron and Leto is brutally murdered by the sardukar.

161,I'm not here to upset anyone and I have been reading the reviews since coming out of the movie because I feel confused like I missed somethingMusic/ acting/ some action scenes/ location/ cgi all absolutely outstanding and I'm glad I saw it on the big screen but the story just isn't gripping at all and it's such a shame because the acting and the casting was spot on.I would recommend that every person watches this film once because it is an experience and maybe I will have a more positive opinion once part 3 is out and the full story is there but overall a lot of hype with a minimal payoff at the end.Like I said this is my opinion and I hope I can see this 10/10 film people are raving about if I rewatch it.,positive
162,"Dune 2 had some great Cinematography along with great acting. However, this movie is far from Epic. The action was sparse but enjoyable after lengthy periods of dialogue. The approval rating had me hyped to see this movie. It was far from fulfilling for me and my spouse agrees.""We"" would not have paid for this movie had we known it was so disappointing.I was hoping for more aspects of the book, such as training the Fremen in the ""weirding way"". Where was the secret weapon that Feyd-Rautha used in the book? When Feyd stabbed Paul during the fight, the first wound was a knife to Paul's left side. They continued to fight, Paul killed Feyd and the knife wound was in Paul's right shoulder????I certainly will not be going to the theater to see the next episode ! ! !We felt that the movie was overrated and would not recommend for people who read the ""Dune"" book(s).",positive
163,"Yes, Dune 1 & 2 are probably the best sci-fi movies ever. I can't really come up with anything else that would beat these anyway.Part Two was a nice continuation to Part One, however I felt the last part of the movie could have been better or maybe it just went too fast. Without spoiling its hard to explain. Also missed some more insight about the mother and a lot of other things as well...
Imagine if this could have been a 20 episode serie with same quality!Anyhow visually and the main cast were just excellent. I did expect more out of the emperor Christofer Walken.Just love the tonality of the entire movie and the sound and music made it masterful.Please more of these ""adult"" epic sci-fi movies and series!",positive
164,"I read the first 3 Dune books about 15 years ago, I was a pretty big Dune dork back in the day, but then my interest waned and life got in the way. So I'd say my POV is somewhere between a mega Dune fan, and the general audience who doesn't know anything about the books. Zoom forward to 2021 and though I was excited for Part 1, I wasn't blown away by it (though I must admit I've enjoyed Part 1 more and more each time I've watched it). I went into Part 2 more curious than excited, but my gosh was I surprised by how much I enjoyed it!! I was running a little late to my showtime, and didn't get a chance to use the restroom before. I kept waiting for a ""slow"" or boring scene to sneak out--and that scene never came. Every moment felt important, and each scene held my attention so completely, that I decided the discomfort of needing to void wasn't worth missing a beat. So I guess it's rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before, but learn from my mistakes! Dune Part 2 is mesmerizing, beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. It's been a really long time since I've had such a visceral reaction to a movie; I kept thinking to myself, ""the movies are back!!"" And even though it's long, by the end I was actually sad because I wanted more...although at least I could finally pee! ;)",positive
165,"This movie is quite possibly the best sci-fi film ever made. The cinematography, the score, the chapters and how the story unfolds is so satisfying. This is not a 1 to 1 adaptation from the source material obviously but the choices that Denis(the director) and Grieg(the cinematographer) made were so intelligent. The world building is spectacular, the fights are action packed, the emotional weight in certain scenes is palpable. The actors all played their rolls flawlessly with stand out performances by Timothy chalemet, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem and Zendaya. I can't think of anything more they could have done to make this film more enjoyable.. except perhaps add another hour. 10/10 no question.",positive
166,"Dune Part Two is one of the greatest creations or triumphs in the history of cinema. The world-building and the world itself, along with our characters, makes you wanna snort a pile full of spice straight from the sand dunes of Arrakis and fight alongside Paul Atreides the entire time. That's how immersive the story, visuals, and music are. It is UNMATCHED.A generation-defining film indeed, and when we discuss sequels, this could very well stand in contrast with 'The Empire Strikes Back,' 'The Dark Knight,' and 'The Two Towers'-or even surpass them in some cases. We owe Denis a great debt for this masterpiece. You can keep your expectations as high as the sky, but Denis will blow your mind either way and show you that even the sky isn't the limit. No one was and is prepared for this.LONG LIVE CINEMA.",positive
167,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. True to sci-fi, dark, intense, amazing cinematography, quality acting, and with exciting action. I still find it hard to believe that a movie with so much in it is so well put together. As well, I'm quite surprised that it's received so much mainstream buzz because it partially feels like a real sci-fi movie if that makes any sense. But I can understand how there's enough here to appeal to all fans of cinema.It's an instant classic for me. It actually surpassed Dune Part One and delivered on all fronts. Part One did a great job at setting the scene and Part Two knocked it out of the park. I would give it a 9.5/10 because it's a bit long and there's a lot to follow throughout the entirety of the movie, it can get a bit taxing. Loved this movie!",positive

169,"I was very excited about seeing Dune part two today. I have been waiting for it with expectancy. Number one was so good that I've watched it half a dozen times because it's so much like the book. I have only one question and one criticism of this movie, why did you have to change the end? Everything was going along just fine until you changed the ending. Frank Herbert wrote a great story, a great book and a great ending and I just don't understand why you needed to change the end It's very disappointing and it's not worth watching again because it's not the story that I am used to. So as I said, after the Kyle McLaughlin version of Dune, what book did you read? Because it certainly wasn't Dune.",positive

171,"I get making some changes for the screen. I get leaving some stuff out, expanding some other stuff. But the changes, fundementally change the story, characters, their motivations etc. And usually for the worse. Not to mention the plotholes it creates.I reread Dune, minutes after I read the final page, I watched both movies back to back. While rewatching the first movie, I was super hyped. I noticed small details I missed the first time. I liked the movie even more than the first time, despite some of my issues with it. E.g. No dinner party, no letter from Fenring. But for the most part it was a pretty faithful adaptation. Rewatching it, I do see the signs of the story being set up for major change in the second part. Like how they mention Shani's name as ""desert flower"" (Siyaha) and Chani says ""I hate it, it's part of the dumb prophecy"" ... Siyaha is the pet name/hypercorism that Paul uses for Chani. It's not her actual name or part of the prophecy. But when she said this, I knew it was a set up for her much expanded role in the second movie. (It comes back when Chani wakes Paul up from the water of life and everyone is like ""Lisan al-Gaib was saved by the desert flower's tears just like in the prophecy!""Anyway, the second movie deviates far too much from the books and most of the changes aren't good.1. Fremen are religiously and ideologically divided. The North doesn't believe in the prophecy, while the east (who they keep calling ""the fundementalists"") do. So .. then why don't the tribes in the north use the water? Esp since they've tied the water into the prophecy, when it wasn't in the books. Stilgar is the leader of the Tabr Sietch, which is in the North. Stilgar is from the south. Why is everyone ok with this guy being their leader? Wouldn't youth constantly challenge him if they don't believe, which means they are just sitting on insane amounts of water for nothing. Instead Fremen refuse to listen to Stilgar and challenge him, but never to fight for leadership. In one scene you have Chani standing with a group of young women and some very American looking black bros, screaming the prophecy is fake. While Stilgar is on the other side with a group of bearded middle eastern looking dudes, yelling that Paul is the Lisan Al Gaib. It's like they're saying ""only these bearded, cis, brown people believe in this prophecy, these hip young girls and bros are too cool for school."" P.s. I mention black people because later in the movie, they seem to all disappear. When they go south, there are suddenly no more black fremen.2. Paul doesn't get accepted into the Fremen after he fights Jamis. He doesn't take part in Jamis' water ritual. He doesn't get Jamis' stuff .. which includes his stepson, son and wife Haran. He doesn't even get his Tabr Sietch name (Usul) until much later. In fact, I absolutely DETESTED the scene where Paul and Jessica reach Tabr Sietch. Having the entire crowd, chant, yell and scream nonsensically. It really gives ""Hollywood middle east vibes,"" I'm Turkish and I cringed. They cry over Jamis, threaten Paul and Jessica etc and claim the don't accept. Stilgar accepted them. They've proven themselves infront of Fremen warriors. But as I said, Stilgar seems to have zero power. The whole point is that they don't accept people easily. But when they do, they see you as part of their group. Even the sons of Jamis are super psyched about having Usul, possibly the Lisan Al Gaib as their stepdad in the book. I did really like that they made Paul see Jamis as a friend in his prescience. But even that sours when they push Jamis as this father / mentor figure over Stilgar.3. Stilgar is a worshipper from the start. Man has barely any doubt. Stilgar in the book isn't as fanatical. He isn't sure that Paul is the one but changes as more and more signs reveal themselves and Paul gains more and more powers (like being able to predict the future and know the past). Paul laments how Stilgar, who was once his friend is now just one of his worshippers. This change never truly happens in the movie. From the very start, Stilgar, without any scepticism, is playing the role of the naive, brainwashed, ultra religious radical who sees what he wants to see. ""He said he isn't the Lisan Al-Gaib, such a Lisan Al-Gaib thing to say!"" Stilgar has to ask a council permission to allow Paul and Jessica to stay.4. Jessica immediately becomes their reverend mother, when she's barely been a Sayaddina. Nor even accepted! The ritual is completely different, the circumstances too. And we never get the fremen ""water of life, drug fuelled orgie"" (which I'm convinced is what inspired the Zion party scene in one of the matrix movies).5. The movie's time frame is messed up. In the books Paul spends 3 / 4 years with the Fremen before the end of the book. The movie does all this withing less than 9 months (Jessica is pregnant at the start, still pregnant in the end). I get why they didn't add Alia. I get how impossible it is to have a 2 / 3 year old girl run around, talk and behave like an adult. And even at one point kill people and finish off wounded sardaukar and harkonnen.6. Alia believes in the prophecy, Jessica as a result also believes in the prophecy. And she pushes Paul to accept the prophecy. To drink the water. In the book Paul choses to drink the water himself, secretly (to expand his ability to see the future). In fact Jessica would never approve or advice that in the books. In the books Jessica is worried about Paul becoming more and more of a religious figure.7. The Baron is too stoic and silent. Raban is comically angry. Feyd never tries to kill the Baron instead its the otherway around. Feyd fighting the undrugged Atreides soldier is no longer a Thufir Hawat + Feyd plan, since Thufir is completely gone from the story. Really dislike the ""Harkonen are all pale white, bald guys"" and the weird easthetic their planet has. It kinda looks goofy and empty. I get that it's geiger esque it just doesn't fit well. Like when lady Fenring goes into her room .. it resembles an alien machine chamber not a room.8. Chani tells Paul that Stilgar won't teach him how to ride worms because he's not a real fremen, but only one in name etc. She also claims all Fremen are equal (they are NOT .. sure they are equal, as in all can challenge the leader etc. But they have leaders and the leaders make the decisions)9. Chani is a Fedaykin. And women among the Fremen are all loud mouth, boyish warriors. Fedaykin in the book are a warrior cast that we first hear about when they start acting like Paul's devoted, radical body guards and personal guard/warriors. In the movie, Paul becomes a Fedaykin.10. Women among the Fremen in the books have very strict roles. Yes, they are strong, hardy women. Yes, they can and will fight. But, they seem to be completely devoted to their husbands and blindly follow their command. They don't even argue even if they want to argue. They don't talk back etc etcIn the book Chani is such a wildly different character. And I'd be ok with making Chani a bit more independent or strong willed. But Chani as the one that doesn't accept the prophecy? The leader of the anti prophecy people? Chani as the person that constantly yells the prophecy is fake? Especially considering that she's in love with Paul, and we tend to ignore all red flags while in love. Plus Paul fits every part of the prophecy and does a bunch of miraculous things. That makes no sense to me. In the books a guy comes to challenge Paul because he doesn't believe the prophecy. Chani kills him. When Paul asks her why she did that. She says ""When the other men find out that those who challenge Usul might die by the hands of Usul's women, they might think twice and avoid the possibile humiliation of being killed by a woman. Less people will challenge you as a result, my love"" (paraphrasing). Chani also treats Jessica with a high degree of respect and formality in the book. While in the movie she's constantly being rude to Jessica, to Paul, to Stilgar etc.10. The guild BARELY plays a role. The most important faction is barely even mentionned. CHAOM is barely mentioned. A lot of stuff will happen but then they'll abruptly skip over or forget about it. Like, Stilgar makes Paul do a trip on his own in the desert. But then Chani shows up to ""save him"" / help him do his ""lone trip in the desert."" But we never get to see him do the challenge or return to Stilgar. It just cuts to a whole other scene and circumstance from there.11. Paul talks about ""the fundementalist troops"" (southern troops) and makes a distinction between them and the Fedaykin. The Fedaykin are literally Fremen Qaida. They run into death with no fear, chanting the name Muad'dib. The Fedaykin are all fundementalists in the book. Fedayin is a word used for irregular rebel bands and guerilla fighters. E.g It's pretty widely used in the Muslim world and also among some none Muslims.12. People seem a lot more stupid in the movie. They will openly talk about secret and or touchy subjects infront of everyone. E.g. Gurney for some reason thinks it's ok to loudly tell Paul that he should make use of this prophecy, use the Fremen as a tool even if he doesn't believe it etc. The only fremen that even reacts to it is Chani who is clearly upset at what she hears.13. Chani knows the prophecy is a false prophecy planted by offworlders without anyone telling her about it. She just knows.I absolutely detested the ending of the movie with everyone going on the Jihad while Chani remained on her own in the desert. I can already see that they've set Chani up to become the anti Paul rebel. I have a lot more to say, but we've reached the character limit. It was very well filmed. Well acted. But they ruined the story. I get some changes. Like removing Alia since it would be very hard to do Alia properly. But a lot of the changes are really bad and nonsensical.Book fan score 7. Movie fan score 8.5.",positive
172,"Visually it only breaks down during the overhead scenes when Arakkeen is being taken. The composits and the firey explosions were rushed and they're keenly visible.Now onto the meat of it: the story. It diverges from the book, which is fine to do with purpose but that's sorely missing here. What purpose was there in that duel if the great houses didn't care one bit for it?The movie went out of its way to make the Fremen seem a lot more frenzied and fanatic than they were in the books - to the detriment of their humanity and strategic use. A bunch of Fremen commandeering space-travelling vessels to carry their Jihad into space was as unbelievable as it was nonsensical due to their strong ties to the desert. They weren't ferried unto other planets to wage war as much as to deal with the overhead armada - why would they be capable of doing that, even with stolen ships?One of the key takeaways from the book was the author's insights into the ecology of the planet - which is absent from both movies, although touched upon briefly - that goes directly with the reasoning behind the final scene and threat: Fremen don't need the spice but the entire galaxy does; the Fremen's ultimate goal directly involves affecting spice's continued existence.This movie does none of the above and chooses to lean heavily into Paul being the less-keen-but-forced-at-the-slightest-provocation leader of a genocidal cult whose only narrative purpose is to genocide the galaxy - as it is said over and over again.If you know current day politics, you recognize the political undertones even more-so than the day the book was written: the West are the Great Houses, Paul is the hebrew Messiah leading the unwashed and dull-witted hordes into cleaning the world of the oppressors.An insult to the book.",positive
173,"I loved this movie. It was never boring and the characters were perfectly cast. Timothy was great as Paul. There were a lot of fight scenes but they did not ruin the rest of the movie. I may end up seeing it a second time. Fayed was the best looking Feyed so far. I felt if i has not read the book, then i might not have known what was happening to Paul via the spice. I did miss seeing his sister, and I don't quite understand why they changed that, even though I read the explanation. There are a few movies that i have been looking forward to, but this was number one on the list. It will be intersting to see how it does at the boxoffice.",positive
174,"The perfect sequel to a film that sets the stage for the second part. ""Dune 2"" brings religious and political parallels that allow for a profound reflection on our own society. The cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay, and acting performances are simply impeccable. I feel that each frame of this film could be used as a photograph in a museum. The fascinating and exceptional soundtrack, combined with the splendid cinematography, immerse me so deeply that I feel like I'm on Arrakis. The well-crafted screenplay ties up loose ends and continues the story in a natural and captivating way, thrilling the viewer with each passing minute. The performances of everyone involved are brilliant, with special mention to the young actor Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet, who portrayed an incredible role as Paul Atreides with his authoritative voice and leadership demeanor persuading everyone, including viewers. There is simply nothing to complain about in this second film; it embodies cinema at its core. ""Dune 2"" is one of the most formidable cinematic experiences of the last decades and will forever be one of the best experiences for a lover of good films. It will surely become a benchmark for sci-fi/fiction and for creating an excellent masterpiece. ""Dune 2"" is absolute cinema.",positive
175,"Coming into this film, I had the highest expectations. Leaving this film, my expectations were somehow surpassed. The characters, plot, action, cinematography, sound design; every aspect of this film was finely tuned to perfection. Every scene is masterfully crafted, ingrained in my brain. The fight scenes were as tense and thrilling as the Dune Part 1, if not more so. The dialogue was engaging, the sound effects beautiful, and the music was the perfect backdrop to each scene. The directors and writers also use silence incredibly well, providing stark contrasts to the booming bass that tends to be used in larger fights. The characters feel believable, and have their own motivations, purposes and personalities, allowing their relationships to flourish. All this without even commenting on the visuals. This film is a cinematic masterpiece, the CGI and the practical effects being stunning. The way the various worlds are portrayed is expertly done. Absolutely one of the best films I have ever watched, 10/10 would recommend.",positive
176,"To be honest this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in years, Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done it better. The buildup for the main idea of the movie was unbelievable, how he planted the idea of the movie in the back of our mind was out of this world, this only happens when you take care of the least of the details, we can see in this movie how Denis made sure that he didn't waste any detail. The amount of details in the movie can be compared to the greatest movies ever made, everything was on point the designs of the locations were outrageous, the accent difference between the Northern and Southern people of Arakkis, the clothing to be honest everything was on point. The outrageous buildup made the conclusion very glorious and we cannot wait to see Dune: Part 3.Thank you Denis for this Masterpiece.",positive
177,"There is something about Dune. You either dig it or you don't. I dig it. In fact I love it.Dune came out as a novel in 1965, it is set in the mind bogglingly distant year of 23,352 AD : ten thousand years after mankind has overthrown the intelligent machines it created.The demon of AI has already been conceived and defeated. So unlike a lot of sci-fi this story is about people and not about their clever machines.It could easily have been set during the Crusades. It has grandeur, it is expansive. It is complex.It is about belief and faith, it is full of religious fervour, about survival against the odds. It is also about revenge and justice.It is about careful manipulation, sowing the seeds of prophecy; nurturing it , of plans that span 90 generations. About knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comes.But at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bring.Dune is influential.If you've watched the Star Wars films, Dune's reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar. (After the success of the first Star Wars film , Lucas termed himself too big to sue).I have read Dune many times. I have watched the David Lynch film more times than I can remember. In fact I have watched Dune part one about five times.The casting in this version is perfect. The effects are impressive and on the big screen the sound immersive and there is some really quite striking imagery.Dune has almost become a holy book for the sci-fi fan of a certain age, it even has a messiah. I am that kind of fan. Watching it has become a religious experience. You feel like you are watching the prophecy you know so well come true. That makes it powerful.That makes Dune part two simply superb.",positive
178,"I watched the part one back at its realise and it was a very nic exiting exciting experience. The scenario had a mystery. Nice characters and acting. The movie ends and you stay with questions and mystery. The part two requires you to watch the first. The scenario continues where the part one ends with the same tone and the amazing for me backroung sound and music especialy in the cinema. The certain thing is that the part two doesnt disappoint in any section, I thing that only improves and when I mean improve I dont say in technical terms but the viewer appreciate even more the scenario the characters every spectrum of the film. Thats because you start to be more familiar and you start to like that you have a bigger picture on the lore. Dont mistaken me the first part in my opion it was at the same level of quality as the second both movies awesome and the mystery on what happens next even at the same scene is there and it does it nice. I think that with this movies warner bros bring back a franchise who deserve movies like this and I am very glad that I watched them both. They deserve your time dont miss them. (the cgi effects was clean like CLEAN)",positive
179,"Saw the Dune ¬¨‚â§ film today.Really enjoyed it and it had some good visuals.Well worth seeing and I look forward to the inevitable pt3. But......
Disappointed the new films didn't utilise the Bene Gesserit 'Weirding Way' power, so no weaponised modules. Ô£ø√º√≤¬¢ the 'voice' is still used though of course.I'm all for diversity. And given the books mirror on the worlds religions and politics this was fitting to have all cultures involved. But was there a need to gender swop as well as race swop a character? Ô£ø√º¬ß√ÆIt's a great sci fi film but it's not quite the masterpiece it's being heralded as imo.I'm sure it will predictably win countless awards. FX. Couple of actors performances.The script shouldn't though imo.The ending felt totally rushed and zero resistance felt, no tension. Far too easy and brief a victory imo. Could have done with at least another half hour to really feel them gaining ground and getting ever closer to the Emperor. But no........they were there at the doors in a heartbeat which I was surprised by. Missed opportunity to build tension, suspense and bring great performances from the cast especially Walken is wasted here. (More on that later)Feyd actor wasn't great and looked like a cross between Matt Lucas (Little Britain) and the Engineers from Prometheus Ô£ø√º√≤√Öand his 'Birthday' scene in the arena seemed pointless and badly executed.Batista's lack of acting abilities showed in this to the point he just shouted all his dialogue and hoped for the best.Christopher Walken seemed wasted and was never really allowed to embrace the role with the little screen time he had. Didn't come across as Emperor at all. No grandeur at all. This is the Emperor of the Universe !!?Anyone elsenspot the almost Monty Python Life of Brian moment. ""Only the true Messiah would deny he is the Messiah"" (or words there abouts) nearly had us shouting out ""He's not the Messiah he's a really naughty boy!"" Ha ha. Ô£ø√º√≤√áÔ£ø√º√≤√áAgain. Well worth the watch though. The religious nods to real life from the book, the jihad, the politics are there although most is skirted over as it wouldn't make quite an exciting film. It's more style over substance. Visually nice yet not hugely engaging intellectually.The designs for the spaceships seemed a little bland also, no real style or identity for each 'House'. At least Lynch film had some well thought out difference in the look of each houses palace and ships etc.Bland. Especially after seeing what H R Giger had designed for the Harkonen style (for a film that sadly never got made many years ago). Oh how incredible that would have been If only it had happened. Ô£ø√º√≤¬¢Ô£ø√º√±¬ßNownif only we could see Lynch's first 14hr cut. Ha ha. Love to see what treasure we're inside that version.Bring on pt3. I'll still watch. It will be popular. But they tooling themselves with all thebgushing about masterpiece.",positive
180,"I mean if you were to sum up humanity in one movie... this would be it!So layered and nunanced in the deep topics it explores, yet it communicates this through a visual and visceral soundscape.I haven't had such an immersive movie experience like this since Interstellar and that was up there until now as one of the best films made in my opinion.Not only are we lucky to have one GOAT film maker alive at this moment in time but we have two simultaneously in Villeneuve and Nolan.Having finished the book about an hour before my first screening this evening I was apprehensive in how the story would be translated visually due to its complexity but it blew past all my expectations and then sum.This is the result of having the best of the best in their respective fields coming together to produce a Masterpiece be it in Fraser's cinematography, Zimmer's sound scape or the costume, set design and VFX departments... acting, writing and directing at the highest calibre.Do yourself a favour and watch this on the big screen, IMAX, Dolby Atmos to capture the true effort gone into creating this work of art and to do it justice. It will go down in our history as one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
181,"Paul Atreides and his mother are now living with the Fremen following the Harkkonen bid to wipe out clan Atreides. Paul comes to prominence because it seems he may fulfil a prophecy, which may enable him to obtain revenge against the Harkkonens and also the Emperor, who facilitated their action in the first place. But Paul has visions of a war he wants to avoid, and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood have plans of their own.Part Two picks up where the first film left off, and brings the story to a conclusion of sorts (author Frank Herbert wrote five sequels). I was a huge science fiction reader when the original novel was published, but I had a great deal of trouble with it. Its texture and density was a bit too much for me in my mid-teens, and previous film versions didn't help much. I was pleased with Villeneuve's film from 2021, because I could finally follow the story without confusion.Part Two - not so much. The narrative is fairly straightforward, but it often felt as if exposition had been omitted. For instance, Lea Seydoux appears in some tight closeups and meaningful dialogue: she plays Lady Margot Fenring. Who? This is presented as a character of significance, a name actress with image and dialogue delivered using film grammar which shouts Significant! Yet we don't know who she is or why she matters, and we never hear from her again.The performances are good, the visuals are great, but again the story proves difficult to convey without confusion. It's a good film, but it's something of a disappointment compared to its predecessor,",positive
182,"The production value of the sets and scene is spectacular. Now that is out of the way the movie is very average and nothing really happens. The editing is very choppy and the movie keeps jumping here and there. Everything happens conveniently for the main character. The fight sequence which i was waiting for were short and underwhelming.Props to the director for making it almost 3 hours long but still unable to stitch a decent storyline. Poor Zendaya was so underutilized that it made no sense why Paul was having dreams of her in the first part. His premonitions were so useless, his dreams in the first part didn't warn him about the massacres about to happen to his family but kept showing him Zendaya (really useless superpower to have). There are multiple oscar winning actors who have been criminally underutilized (Josh Brolin, Javier B, Chris W).Again the production value is great and makes it watchable but was too slow, nothing really happened and when it happened was underwhelming.",positive
183,"It almost never happens, but Paul's fight with Feyd-Rautha actually raised my heartbeat, and that was despite knowing how it would pan out! Music was sublime, and definitely a step up even from the masterwork that Hans Zimmer cooked up for the first part. Acting was impeccable from the whole cast, the action scenes were a joy to behold, and the CGI is simply on par with the best looking films out there. It is an instant classic, and Denis Villeneuve deserves all the plaudits he will inevitably receive, alongside the incredible crew of course! Definitely one for the big screen, unmissable, and a truly unforgettable experience... Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet is a revelation in this film, his acting is simply incredible, he fills every single scene he is in to its absolute brim with his presence. Rebecca Fergus on, Zendaya and Javier Bardem are also an absolute delight to watch. Having watched the Part 1 reissue a couple of weeks back meant I was up to date and I could enjoy the plot to the fullest. I shall be starting with the books soon enough and I already can't wait for the following film. Mr. Villeneuve, I sincerely feel like you spoiled us with this film. Bravo.",positive
184,"Dune Part 2 is cinema. Pure, unbridled cinema. It combines blockbuster level polish and action with some of the most thought-provoking, timely themes in a sci-fi movie in the past decade.The writing is thoughtful and engaging. The acting from everyone is absolutely superb (standouts from Javier Bardem and Timothee Chalamet). The music is stunning, and the sound design even more so. Giant sand monsters have never felt more menacing, and explosive action scenes never more raw. The CGI is exquisite. Never once do any of the alien worlds presented feel artificial. The best part, though, has to be the cinematography. Almost every single shot could be a wallpaper, poster, or painting.In an age where big-budget movies are floundering, and tired franchises are puttering out, Dune is bringing crowd-pleasing, epic movies back. I can't wait for the next chapter.Long live the fighters!",positive
185,Any one that gives a rating less than 9-10 lack taste for great movies. They are the problem of this world and they never see the good in anything.Dune 2 is one of the best movies I have even seen and I'm an avid movie fan across all genres. I will recommend you watch the first part if you've not seen it before or just to get a recap and then go get your minds blown away. Certain moments will definitely stick with me for a while and the journey Timoth‚àö¬©e took from the start till end of the movie was phenomenal. I could barely recognize him and just found myself chanting Lisan Al Ghaib also. Thanks.,positive
186,"Dune 2 is a stunning sequel that delivers on the promise of the first part and takes the epic sci-fi saga to new heights. Director Denis Villeneuve has crafted a visually spectacular and emotionally gripping film that explores the themes of destiny, power, and resistance in a complex and fascinating universe.The film picks up where the first one left off, with Paul Atreides (Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the Fremen, the native people of the desert planet Arrakis, who are fighting against the brutal rule of the Harkonnen family. Paul is seen by some Fremen as their prophesied messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach, who will lead them to freedom and glory. However, Paul is also haunted by visions of a bloody future that he may not be able to avoid.Dune 2 expands the scope and scale of the story, introducing new characters and locations that enrich the world-building and the plot. We meet the mysterious Bene Gesserit sisterhood, the powerful Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the cunning Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), and the fierce Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), who becomes Paul's love interest. We also travel to different planets, such as the water-rich Caladan, the industrial Giedi Prime, and the imperial Kaitain.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning cinematography, production design, costumes, and special effects. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are breathtaking, the sandworms are awe-inspiring, and the space battles are thrilling. The film also boasts a phenomenal score by Hans Zimmer, who creates a haunting and immersive soundscape that blends orchestral, electronic, and ethnic elements. The film is best experienced in IMAX, where the sound and the visuals are amplified to create a truly immersive experience.The film also features excellent performances from the cast, who bring depth and nuance to their roles. Chalamet is superb as Paul, portraying his inner conflict and his growing charisma and confidence. Ferguson is equally impressive as Jessica, who balances her maternal instincts and her loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. Zendaya is captivating as Chani, who shares a strong chemistry with Chalamet and adds a touch of romance to the film. Bardem, Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd, Bautista, and Butler are also memorable as the Fremen leader Stilgar, the grotesque Baron Harkonnen, the savage Beast Rabban, and the sinister Feyd-Rautha, respectively.Dune 2 is not a film that tries to please everyone. It is faithful to the source material by Frank Herbert, which means that it is complex, dense, and challenging. It does not shy away from the dark and violent aspects of the story, nor does it simplify the political and religious implications. It also does not offer a conventional or satisfying conclusion, as it is only the second part of a planned trilogy. However, for those who appreciate the vision and ambition of Villeneuve and Herbert, Dune 2 is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen.",positive
187,"Music: 10/10, Hans Zimmer has done it again, another soundtrack given straight from godGraphic: 10/10, I don't know how, I don't know why, the visual is just pure eye candy, everything look beautiful, yet intimidating at the same timestory: things start to pick up from the first Dune. Yes the first Dune is slow burn, but everything got a proper paid off in this movie, yes this movie ends with a cliff hanger, but a lot of thread got resolved in this movie and it is master of class of story writingWorld Building: Yeah Frank Herbert is a master in this field, he wrote one of the most affluential book series, and this movie did Frank's work its justice. Everything is fantastic, over-the-top, but it does make senseNow, I need Dune 3, right now, Warner, please make it fast, you have earned at least 1 ticket from me already. For now, I will go rewatch it. This movie is way too good to just watch it one.",positive
188,"For me Part One was the best movie of the past years and I was afraid Part Two couldn't keep up with it. So I was excited but also afraid to be disappointed.After seeing Part Two I can't tell whether Part Two is even better than Part One, but it is truly an equal masterpiece.The visuals are overwhelming again. This time there are even outstanding scenes in black and white.The sound is captivating and Hans Zimmer gets the blood flowing again. This gives the scenes in almost complete silence a special meaning.The storybuilding is also remarkable. You can really see the characters' development and also increasing tension between them.All in all this movie is the epitome of filmmaking. After almost 3 hours I still didn't want it to end. Some scenes gave me goosebumps and I can't wait to see the next chapter.",positive
189,".. there is a wall. Not a shield wall, that protects Arrakeen from the deep desert, but rather a cultural wall. A wall where those who came before are used to a higher quality, a finesse in filmmaking, which is lost on those who came later. Who like LOUD, BIG, and absolutely on-the-nose film.While i place on a pedestal the immortal masterpiece by Lynch, Dune 2 was just mediocre. Not as bad as Dune .. uh .. 1? But still not really good.I mean, i can't forget that i have seen 1984 Dune, so maybe i could like this a bit more if the first film never existed. I could forget the magnificent sets, the fantastic costumes, the amazing soundtrack, the superb direction and pacing, the acting of Jose Ferrer, of Kenneth McMillian, of Max von Sydow. We could forget that Lynch figured out that Space Kungfu wouldn't work and fixed the fighting and the ending, but then i would be left only with what little Dune 2 has to offer - a bunch of bland CGI stolen from the internet, horrible costumes, and a story which would maybe have better impact if it had anything like a decent direction. While VIlleneuve did the fairly good Sicario, to me he will always be the guy who made a mockery of Blade Runner.And here is the wall. You either do, or do not like. You are on one side or the other. You can't like the new Blade Runner and also like the old one, you can't like Dune 2 and Dune 1984 at the same time, because if you grew up with the cinema sensibility that created such masterpieces as the original Dune and Blade Runner, you will simply be bored at the complete lack of artistic quality that their remakes have. And if you DO like the new ones, you don't even know what to look at, when you're shown the old ones.Dune 2 was bad. Not horrible bad, but disappointing, sad bad. Sad that we insult the intelligence of our audience so much, and sad that they can't even tell.My vote: i don't know, 10/10 if you are a teenager, 5.5/10 if you are an adult.",positive
190,"The comparison between the two movies and the book is unfair. The book is much better than the movies. There's no denying that. The first part of Dune was a reasonable adaptation. This second part was a very good adaptation. However, beyond being an adaptation, Dune, part one, was a good movie, whereas this Dune, part two, was a very good movie.If we stick to the film as an adaptation, it will lower its rating, but if we focus on the film as a pure and simple cinematic work, it's a great film and surely, if not the best film of the year, it will be among the top 5. It's a movie to be seen and rewatched in the cinema at least twice. It's genuinely good!",positive
191,"Dune Part 1, a movie incomplete in itself was made setting the stage for something bigger. Though, Dune 2 did not disappoint, it certainly didn't achieve anything great.The movie starts off fine establishing the characters and where they stand now. However, the transition of Paul accepting the title of Lisa Al Gaib was rather half baked and not convincing. He just sees his sister in the future and decides all of a sudden the prophecy etched by his mother and the council, which he despised all this time was the only way to go forward.Even, the main antagonist at least in some aspects. Feyd Rautha was introduced in a rushed manner, and just seemed to exist to create some power dynamic and he was disposed like Harkonnen's leader when they served no purpose to the story. There is no respect for the ploy you build and these villains were just set up to fail.All in all the story is pretty crude, though the cinematography is great and the performances by Josh Bulin and Rebecca Ferguson are noteworthy, I just think the movie has to many plot holes to fill and only somewhat lives to the hype.",positive
192,"I went into Dune: Part Two expecting a masterpiece given all the hype, but it left me completely underwhelmed. The storyline feels weak, slow, and overly complicated without a satisfying payoff, and I struggled to stay engaged.The cinematography is impressive, sure, but good visuals alone don't make up for the lackluster narrative. The characters felt underdeveloped, and the pacing dragged so much that I eventually had to switch it off-it was simply too boring.If you're into futuristic, desert-based sci-fi, Furiosa or Mad Max do a much better job of keeping you entertained. Overall, Dune: Part Two just didn't live up to the acclaim for me.",positive
193,"I'm so grateful that I had the chance to see one of my favorite book series coming to life in this astonishing way. The whole length of the movie my eyes was in tears and I had the urge to get up from my chair and get involved in the story.The visuals and soundtrack kept me in a dreamlike state almost all the whole movie. The cast was perfect for each character. I really believe them. Special mentions to Stilgar and Feyd Rautha, I think they deserves some big rewards for their great performance.Even if you didn't read the books, this movie will take you in a place you've never been before. Dare to take this amazing ride and go see it. You'll thank me later.",positive
194,"I first watched the original DUNE(1984) when I was around 10, and was a little nervous when they announced a reboot. Then I watched it, and fell in love with the beautiful set designs, the sfx, and the choreography, a long with the more faithful approach to the story. I found out afterward that a sequel was green-lit only 3 days after the first one's release, and was hyping myself up for the movie. It did not disappoint. I haven't cried in a theater since endgame, but during the final battle sequence it was too beautiful and spectacular not to, seeing a film of one of my favorite novels of all time being adapted in such an incredible way was heart wrenching to say the least. The greatest science fiction movie of all time. I will wait oh so patiently for the third.",positive
195,"This film gave me a taste for cinema, Villeneuve's work is grandioseHans Zimmer's music sublimates the wholeThe actors are all excellent, Chalamet shows that he is certainly one of the most promising actors of his generation.Paul's role reminded me of Eren's place in Attack on titans, he assumes the responsibility of liberating a people who until then dominated. He goes to war against all those who stand up against his will. It's interesting to see its evolution so far.I can't wait to see what Villeneuve will offer us in the third part of this saga, which is well on its way to place itself among the best saga in cinema.",positive
196,"Part Two impressed me in a way I've never been impressed before. As expected, the visuals were top of the line and the action was spectacularly original. Part One was a little too slow pacing; Part Two was a little faster paced but so much more interesting. And I loved Paul's relationship with Chani. I've seen so many cringy, stereotypical, and generic romances, but theirs was moving. I loved how there was so much passion and emotion displayed in their eyes, but left out most of the dialogue associated with other romances. The Emperor may have been the overarching villain, but the climactic fight was Paul's single combat against Feyd-Rautha, and that was something. The choice to not use music or slow motion shots was atypical, but it made for one of the most stressful heart-pounding hand-to-hand fights I've ever witnessed. As a whole, Dune: Part Two is one of the greatest movie experiences of my life, so just imagine watching it in theaters instead of on a mobile device.",positive
197,"The movie is the complete cinematic experience. I loved every single line every moment every little thing that makes this movie.The only thing that is bothering me is the thirst so bad for the next part.I felt like I was in the movie riding a sand worm, I was a fremen. I felt the pain the wonder the joy the anger. This felt like reading the book and you just can't stop. The excellence of this movie is not only the cast or the story it is the very making of it. I loved every dialogue that was uttered. Its just a masterpiece.Though there is a stagnant pace in between it doesn't seem to matter. Because most of the second part of the movie is such a cliff hanger.",positive
198,"Dune 2 is what film making should be. It nails it with awesome visuals, textures, and sound, backed up by top-notch acting. The story's packed with morally complex choices that really make you uncertain what you want from the characters. It's not just a visual treat; it's got layers of emotions and is super fun to watch. You get pulled into its world, feeling every high and low along the ride. It's a mix of eye-popping scenes, deep moments, genuine excitement, and even laugh-out-loud moments. Florence Pugh and Austin Butler are exceptional new additions, making it a total hit. Whether you're in it for the action, the drama, or the sheer spectacle, Dune 2 delivers big time.",neutral
199,"I had great hopes for ""Dune: part two"" since I really liked the first part but I was left a bit disappointed. Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in ""part two"". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases. I'm not saying it's all bad and I liked the movie (the rating shows that) but it could have been so much more.The other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later, it has all the same merits and defects. It is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment. On the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all: it is once again truncated. I accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book, but here it's bad. I get that there is a sequel coming (in theory) but the story is interrupted once again. I've read comparisons to ""Empire Strikes Back"" because it was the middle part of a trilogy, but the plot of that movie was closed. Indeed the last shot of ""Episode V"" is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that ""something is more to come, the final battle is nearing"". ""Dune: part two"" is instead cut anticlimactically.Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed by ""Dune: part two"" which was the movie I was expecting the most this year. I liked it but I felt a lot of wasted potential. It could have been something truly epic and for the ages, instead it has major issues that reduce the impact of the movie itself.",positive
200,"I just got home from seeing the movie. As a huge fan of the Dune universe and having read the original books many times (and even many of the Brian Herbert books) I was very happy with this movie except for several plot holes, one of which I believe is insurmountable.Alia (Paul's sister) is supposed to kill Baron Harkonen and become St. Alia of the Knife. In this version she wasn't even born yet! Chani & Paul were also supposed to have a child together but that wasn't as important as Alia's story line. There were also some more minor plot deviations but for the life of me I don't know how they make Dune Messiah or Children of Dune without St. Alia. I guess we'll see. For non Duneheads it's definitely an excellent movie.",positive
201,"I'm not going to say much. The first part was better. This movie added different plot twists, but then cut off entire subplots from the book. Visually stunning but too fast paced. Normally a fast paced plot keeps you on edge, but in this case everything was developed so quickly, that you simply moved on to the next plot point. I'm sure their will be plenty of fans especially those that never read the book, but IMHO it was missing something. I would dare say it had no heart. The movie just seemed to go through the motions. Eliminate character A , and give his\her part to character B, check. Add a plot twist, does it make sense, who cares, check.",neutral
202,"I'm one of the few who sees the movie as an ""ok"" but not ""wow"" factor! When I saw part 1, it doesn't click to me at all irregardless I'm very open to any plot fact or fiction flick, and after seeing part 1 I said to myself I'll never watch the sequel if it comes out, and yes we all now this sequel went out and saw one of the highest reviews given, so given a chance to see it as it might flip side my not so good reviews, but after seeing the sequel, it was the same as the previous one, yes, visual effects were at its best as always, action scenes were great, actors were excellent at their acting skills but the plot, and its connection for me was still not there, if you ask me, you may or may not watch the flick.",positive
203,"Okay wow!!! I saw Dune 1 for the first time in the cinema a few weeks ago and fell asleep multiple times. I thought it was quite dull and had a huge lack of emotion and the music was incredibly random and loud and so many minutes were wasted on scenery that added nothing to the plot.Well Dune 2 is nothing like Dune 1.Dune 2 is filled with plot progress, character development, action & drama and there are almost no minutes wasted and almost everything was executed brilliantly. I felt like I was in the cinema for a while but still would've prefered it to be double or even triple the length it was just that good.The only regret is not going to IMAX. Movie of the year for sure.",positive
204,"I very rarely give 10/10 ratings to films, but DUNE II is easily the best movie I have ever seen!This is why you go to the cinema: to be entertained!(not to be educated or being pressured to think a certain way).When I go to the cinema and pay for a movie ticket I want quality, I want to be taken on a journey, very simple.'Legendary Pictures' and 'Warner Brothers' have given Denis Villeneuve the respect as an artist and as a story teller to allow him to create his vision on the big screen - as it should be!When studios interfere and micro manage projects it dilutes and spoils the quality of the film (Alien 3 is a perfect example of this).Denis Villeneuve, Hans Zimmer, Jon Spaiths and Greig Fraser are the future of cinema!The 2 hour and 46 runtime just flew by - the pacing was spot on. I easily could have sat there for 3 and a half hours!The score by Hans Zimmer was just unbelievable and perfectly transports you into the world of DUNE for the entire runtime.The cast and performances were all incredible, in particular Javier Bardem as Stilgar, he absolutely believed in Paul and his journey.Timoth√©e Chalamet as Paul Atreides, was just awesome. I haven't seen much of his work prior to DUNE - his performance in part one was more subtle and this film sees him transform intimate a reluctant hero then gradually fully accepting his destiny - his speeches to the Fremen were incredible and gave me the chills.Stellan Skarsg√•rd as the Baron, just perfect casting, absolutely terrifying, a highly intelligent and repulsive character. Very well done.The other stand out performance was Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha - just gave me the creeps anytime he was on screen and totally unrecognisable in the role, he is a chameleon.I want to see DUNE 3 and DUNE Prophecy - let's make it happen!We need to support films like DUNE 2, films that are of a high standard are very special and do not come along very often.Ticket sales unfortunately are what dictates which films are made and we need to pay to see the films that we want to see at the cinema and stop paying for low quality, rubbish films.We need to vote with our own money for the type of movies that we want to see, I am going to see DUNE 2 again.",positive
205,"We just saw it today and I have to say I enjoyed every moment. I missed seeing a movie worth the trip to a cinema and I have lived throughout every moment of it.They did justice to the book, it is so beautifully filmed and created, and the music complements every scene. They also managed to send the correct messages from the book who are still so valid or even more important nowadays. And to be fair the young cast also rose to the occasion and did well for their characters. It was beautiful to watch and impressive to hear.One might say it feels too slow paced at some point but it is for a good reason, and what comes next is explosive. I love it.",positive
206,"A movie of grace and beauty. A faultless sequel to a complex and challenging story. Denis Villenvuve
had joined the pantheon of great sci-fi directors. He understands the source material and brings to life a book that requires so much to do. The actors all excel under his vision and they embody their characters with absolute conviction.The lighting and cinematography is of the highest standard and it should result in many wins at the award season.I eagerly look forward to the next installment and I am very happy to give this movie ten stars. Its a tremendous piece of cinema and everyone should go see it on the big screen.",positive
207,"DUNE PART 2 is a literal masterpiece. Everyone gave a performance of a lifetime, the action is grand and epic, the hand to hand combat is fast paced, the cinematography and vfx are the best I've seen, writing and storytelling are at its finest, the score and sound effects are beautiful and loud. This movie is super immersive. The stand out are timothee, Zendaya and Austin Butler. Pacing is perfect as you are super immerse in the movie that you lost the sense of time. Watch this in an IMAX theatre. There is a little bit of comedy in the first half and there is some quotes to be remembered for decades. This is cinema baby!! Definitely in my top 10 fav movie ever. Watch it.",positive
208,"This is one of the best if not the best sci fi movies ive ever seen, sure it felt a bit rushed but it ticked every box for me as far as sci fi movies go. The scale of the film, fantastic worldbuilding and all of the cast were just amazing. I absolutely love the raw and gritty portrail of the world, it felt real, like that this could actually be a possible future for humanity. As i mentioned before it felt a bit rushed sometimes but that is to be expected when you make a movie adaptation of a book so that did not bother me that much. I do however believe that this film needs to be rated R in order for it to reach its fullest potential. Showing a bit more realism in the battles etc would have made this a 10/10 for me. However the action was still great and the final fight scene was so f*in good.",positive
209,"Dune 1 was novel, captivating and you started to form a connection with the characters. Sadly, this was lost in Dune 2. Whilst the cinematography and music were excellent, there was a whiff of an Art Malik movie about this - style over substance. There were some brilliant scenes and moments.However, the plot lacked direction, was not all that compelling, characters lacked development and depth and the film was just too long, such that it was a slight relief when it ended. Such a shame. I think it has been overrated. I would recommend watching it, but go when well rested and feeling patient...",positive

For the frist time in while i make an exception for Dune part two, and I'm not regret any moment of those two and half hours of masterpiece which definitely is Dune part two. I'm in love with this movie, this is perfection, incredibly balancing between dialogues and action. Music in this movie was also 10/10... Hans Zimmer really knows how to match those instruments with scenes that we see. Next part is acting, and... oh boy... Timoth√©e Chalamet and Austin Butler were my favorites. I don't know what else should I say, this movie was just PERFECT in every aspect.",positive
211,"Initially, the film attacks the goals of the top of the filmography with the quality of the scenes, the set, the costumes and also working with the atmosphere. The actors are convincing and the environment, even if generated in places, is incorporated so that it is almost imperceptible. However, where the film's problem arises is in the dramaturgy. Working with film time is not goot at all. The movie sequences don't always fit together, and the closer we get to the end, the more problems there are in this area. In some places, the tension is cut off, and then the tension is missing and the logic of the characters' actions begins to hide. The worst thing is exactly the feeling of watching a movie. It's great that the film captures and hits, but it can't sustain interest all the time without problems. Just the fact that the viewer asks what time it is and how long it takes in the cinema, he notices the people around him and has to literally struggle to keep watching. When the real world starts talking to him through the illusion of the screen. That's a failure. As the film moves forward and nears the end, it becomes boring. The dramaturgy and the position of the characters in the story, their value for the story completely collapses towards the end and is saved only by the vision of a possible sequel. Well, it's not exactly a bad movie, but as a whole it lacks a pull at goal.",positive
212,"I really was looking forward to seeing this and I was disappointed completely. I read the book, I know about the project of Jodorowsky and I saw the version of David Lynch, so I know what Dune is about.This version had some nice ideas for the cinematography, but nothing more. Timothee Chalamet is a complete let-down. He has exactly two facial expressions: the boyish, somehow stupid smile (fits for Willy Wonka, not for Paul Atreides) and another look of a freezing disappointed puppy. Not enough. There are scenes wre you desperately wait for him to act, but it is all compensated with the massive allways-sounding-the-same score. Yawn. Another let-down: The new version of Feyd-Rautha. I don' t like Sting, but he was much more convincing as a madmen, while Austin Butler just treis hard to act one. And than there are all those plot holes and illogical scenes: The Fremen hide under the sand to attack the harvester, but after some face-to-face-combat they destroy it with laser canon from a long distance. Why the first assault? Just to risk lifes? Stooooopid! Not even Zendaya or Xavier Bardem were worth watching this pathetic attempt of making a SciFi-movie. I'd rather return to David Lynch and the book.",neutral
213,"The perfect movie doesn't exis....
Dune made me feel nostalgia so badly for a time i never lived. I'm so in love with the way it made me feel excited and anxious and amazed in every litle frame and I'm sure this movie would never be the same without Zimmer.The scenes where Chani gets emotional without saying anything shows how phenomenal Zendaya is. Who cries with their chin like that?Also I thought that Timoth√©e evolved a lot as an actor and the third act was breathtaking because of it.I loved how the Bene Gesserit plot shows us a side of the story that resembles real life, I loved the way it all became very tangible.",positive
214,"Not since Lord of the Rings have I been so enthralled by a movie I couldn't wait until I was able to review it.The acting, the story telling, the scenery, the philosophies and human nature. It's so encapsulating I was catching myself being so immersed I forgot I was watching a movie.The continuation of Paul Atreides' story happens at a perfect pace. New characters are introduced in a way that makes you care just enough about them to make it impactful. The telling of the stories of the Bene Gesserit is done masterfully, conveying stuff from the book that is hard to put on screen.If there was one thing I was missing, it's the use of the word ""holy war"" instead of the book accurate ""Holy Jihad"". But I suppose that's just something they have to change.This is a 10 out of 10 if there ever was one.",neutral
215,I don't normally write any reviews. But this I feel I must.Wathced this movie at twilight hours (only time I can get my hands on) in BFI IMAX.Watching movies for over 40 years and I have to say this is probably one of my best cinema experiences ever.Just simply wow. WOW WOW WOW.I loved every minute of it. Its so powerful. I think this director gained enough experience to make something exceptional.I have not read the books so I can't say if it stayed true or not but it doesn't matter to me. The whole sequal is so entralling than the first (of course I do like the first part). The pace was spot on. Didn't feel the movie was long in anyway.Soudtrack super especiall in BFI Imax as it made my blood pounding as it did with the movie.Intense experience and in the end while I was walking to the car I told my son at no stage in the movie that I felt anything was cheesy or forced. It was just perfect.,positive
216,"I watched the first Dune film shortly before Dune 2 was released and was instantly hooked by the story but seeing Dune 2 in IMAX was honestly the greatest sensory cinema experience ever! The score, the cinematography, the rhythmic editing, the acting - all just fantastic. I wasn't a sci-fi person before but this film MADE me a fan! It was the best movie by far I've seen at cinema in a long time. I would watch this film again and again and again. If you're thinking of seeing this film I highly recommend it in IMAX, the thumper sounds are epic and the sheer scale of the world. Just go see it!!!!!!",positive
217,"My mouth was left wide open at many points in the film. This movie rivals interstellar. The visuals were even better than the first film and the acting was incredible. What is a 2 hour 40 minute film felt like an hour and a half to me. The storyline along with the otherworldly music grips you in from the very beginning. A perfect sequel to dune part one in that it's so different to part one but the stakes seem much higher. I will be seeing it again tomorrow after seeing it this evening, which is rare for me.Now we can only hope this film does well enough to justify a production of dune messiah.",neutral
218,"Dude is a pillar of science fiction, and to see it done this well, especially in a climate of relatively subpar cinema has been nothing less than thrilling to watch.Book readers will come away satisfied, and even with our nitpicks with the changes they've had to make from turning a large complex novel like Dune into a two hours and 45 minute movie, I was delighted with the tweaks they made. These changes not only helped make the story more coherent to a casual audience, but also highlighted some character motives without having to dive too deep into other plotlines.For those were just looking to see a well-made piece of cinema, you will not be disappointed. It's a visually stunning, emotionally, gripping, and well crafted cautionary tale on charismatic leaders.Denis Villeneuve take a bow. This is the kind of movie that comes around once every 20 years or so. 10/10.",neutral
219,"So many editing choices made no sense. Somehow Paul runs at a soldier in the beginning leaving his mom behind, then to his left another soldier is coming at him only to be hit on the head from behind...hey must be Chani...no it's his mom...how did she get there so fast and unseen?Then Paul has to prove himself by going into the desert, is given a tent etc and told to go. Next scene he's with Chani..ok np...then the next scene his trial is apparently over and he's there and back already...what?Then he's walking up a hill towards his worm calling, the fremen are seated behind him watching him walk up the hill. Then they are apparently now staring at a field and Paul is over to their right? Huh? He calls a worm and it breaks through the hill that he was standing on continuing to the right, seemingly out of eye to the fremen since the hill was blocking there view of the right...yet somehow they appear to see him riding this worm and cheer.Then they attack a spice harvester, hidden under the sand, seemingly able to hide their digging, footprints but hey ok. Then they attack just as they are able to get run over, an ornicopter takes out seemingly 1/2 of them, then Paul and Chani decide to attack it, while some others go to confront other soldiers. The ornicopter stays on Paul/Chani and can't seem to just move around so it can see under the legs and lets itself be blown up, all ground combat seemingly done with swords/knives for some reason. Next attack on a harvester is completed with only a single laser weapon....why have 1/2 the men killed in the first raid if you had that!So many more scenes that just abruptly happen or people teleporting around for no logical reason. Paul comes into the temple to take the water of life, ""You shouldn't be here"", ""I'm here to take the water of life"", teleport to him with different clothes, ""here you go"". Pretty sure when he takes it he had other people with him and it wasn't done so damn quickly.Alia being a fetus throughout the entire movie made zero sense given they showed what appeared to be her quickened growth in the beginning after the water of life was taken, months and months go by in the desert(Chani telling Paul it's been a long time since he's had his nightmares implies their relationship has been going on a long time) yet Jessica never appears to show further than maybe 6-7 months along...Alia never being born and not killing the Baron. Why??I give this a 6 because despite all these terrible edits/choices the movie is still striking visually, and the costume design was fantastic, but wow...just wow to the above.",positive
220,"Dune Part Two is a masterpiece, which succeeds in combining all the key parts of creating a true epic:
Strange and intriguing characters, well acted, who develop with the storyIncredible world building - writing, language, costume design, cinematography all working together to create the feeling of being in a very different, but very coherent reality.Massive spine tingling moments - action sequences and political set pieces that make you feel emotionally invested in the narrative.A couple of things worth calling out: there are changes to characters and narrative from the book, but they are all relentlessly in service of ensuring that the themes from the book stand more clearly. The narrative is all about the increasing complexity and darkness of the choices facing the lead characters, and like both the book and other Villeneuve films it has no qualms about not answering all the questions it raises.The second is the pacing - I'm not sure there's a two minute sequence in there I would have cared to miss.Finally this is a Dennis Villeneuve film and you absolutely getting his trademark sensational visuals!",neutral
221,"Where s the CHOAM? The role of princess Irulan is almost nonexistent...Alia kills the Baron hence her cult..., Feyd Rautha Harkonenn is so...dull...Chani is so flat...where is the epic of the Great Conqueror, this new Alexander? The banners the armies conquering the Sardaukar, expanding the galaxy known?What about the agony of the spice for the Kwisatz Haderach, the prescience of the future emperor, the future blind claimer, the father of the God Emperor? Is a very beautiful eye experience, colorful, with nice CGI and general scenery and customs, good individual fight scenes and that s almost it...",positive
222,"Its a teen romance drama masqueraded as a scifi movie. From the 2,47 hour runtime 1.30 hours are close up shots of Zendayas face like in soap operas. I saw this movie a few days ago and have already forgotten most of it. People who have rated this as a 10 have most likely forgotten how actual 10s make you feel, those movies stay in your mind for a long while. I mean movies the alien, blade runner, even a little never movies like district 9.. Dune is not even close to those, in any category. Its a sad fact a great scifi epic is reduced to the most simplest form, and theyll be making at least two sequals. I will not spend any money on those nor should you..",positive
223,"No spoilers here: I walked out of the cinema just under an hour ago, and I am writing this while it is still fresh.Disclosure: As a reader of the original material, I am biased.This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen, the score is absolutely phenomenal (Thanks Zimmer) and Villeneuve created an expansive and engaging experience, there were times that I simply couldn't comprehend the effects: although at times the CG did glare it's head.Obviously I haven't seen it back to back with the previous film, yet, but when I have the opportunity I will definitely savour it.Would I recommend, yes. Yes I would, if you enjoyed the first film, books or even Sci-Fi generally. The plot was well written and well executed. Can't wait for the next instalment.",positive
224,"Dune part 2 delivered in every way on what part 1 began, and served as an artfully brilliant adaption of the source material. Frank Herbert's Dune is my favorite book of all time, and I was more than pleased with the translation to the screen that Denis Villeneuve masterfully put together. The scenery, world-building, character development, music, sound effects, pacing, and overall feeling, in my opinion, perfect for this story. There were a few changes from the book that made the story easier to digest on screen, which I felt was appropriate and made the movie better than it would have been had it directly adapted every detail of the book.I especially loved this movie's depiction of Paul's internal struggle with a desire for revenge while at the same time growing love for Chani and the Fremen people. He is clearly stuck in the middle of expectations, controlled prophecies, love, loss, and fear of greater loss and suffering. All of this internal turmoil is heard in Paul's words, tone, and seen on his face. Lady Jessica's portrayal is terrifying and unsettling. Chani is the heartbeat of the story and allows the audience a figure to connect with and respond to the events of the film with. Stilgar is devout and unironically hilarious at times.Every shot of the movie is a work of art. I plan to go back for a 2nd viewing.",positive
225,"Tis movie was great although not without its flaws, but even whith them it dosent take you out of the experience, the atmosphere is ameazing and you feel like you are in the world of Arrakis. Again this movie is not pervect but the flaws arent big enough that you can't look past them. All the actors did an amazing job and even the beckground characters did there all. The music in the movie was one of my favourite parst because it fits perfectly in to the world and help you get immersed even more. I think that the languages where implemented really well to the point where i can see it being an actual language. Like i said this movie is not pervet it has its flaws i feel like a lot of the ideas could have been explored more and i wish we could have seen more ot the desert an the south of Arrakis. It's a genuinely fun and great movie and i can't recommend it enough.",positive
226,"After years of terrible sci-if action films, mainly by Disney we get a movie that lives up to its hype. Dennis Villanueve has done it. He's created an sci-fi action film that does everything right. By the end of the film, the entire theater was silenced in awe. The acting from Zendaya to Chalamet and Brolin was fantastic. My only complaint is I wish the final battle scene was a bit longer. It felt too short, but I'm nitpicking. Go out and spend your hard earned money, this film was meant to see on the big screen. This is truly a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Will be watching again very soon.",positive
227,"Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe, he must prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.I'd like to start off by mentioning that I didn't really like the first Dune. I felt like it was too slow and lacked significant events and was just setting up this part. Looking back, now I understand why that was the case. This part wouldn't have been as good without the setup from part one. The first scene in this movie is really visually beautiful and sets up the tone for the rest of the film. The movie is a 3 hour adventure in this incredible world were time just flys by. The production was fabulous and the action and fight scenes were super entertaining, big credits to the director Denis Villeneuve. Hans Zimmer's score is also a big selling point of the movie as it elevates the watching experience and changes the viewer's mood. The cast is also perfect and you can sense that there's a strong chemistry between all of the actors. The story is incredibly good but the storytelling could be a bit better. There are some points that leave you with question marks. But maybe that is left to be explained later. Which brings me on to the next point, I need closure. This film seems like its also setting up a next film so that's more than five hours of set up (with the durations of part one and two combined) with no clear end or a bit of closure. I get that this is supposed to be a big Sci-Fi film series but there has to be a point of where I feel like i didn't spend 5 hours on a journey with no sense of ending. Hopefully they change my mind regarding this point by the time Dune:Part Three releases. Other than that, it was an absolutely amazing film that has to be watched.Score:8.5/10.",positive
228,Please keep this going through all six books. This is the absolutely best rendering of a very complex story. The first Dune was OK. The BBC mini series was good. This kicks it out of the ball yard. The characters and acting nail it. Please keep going because this book series deserves this kind of engagement and understanding. The debunking of the messiah myth. The conflict is perfectly recognized in this rendition. I can't wait for the next part of this and seeing how you render the God emperor. I have been a big fan of the books since they came out and have actually used one in one of my classes. Please keep going. Perfect!,positive
229,"I went into this with big hopes, I was waiting for my day off of work to specifically see this at the cinema on IMAX.Dune 1 (for me) is within the top 4 greatest 'Sci-Fi' movies. I say 'Sci-Fi' because it was futuristic i.e 'with greater technology' which (for me) results in 'Sci-Fi'.Dune 2 was immense as an IMAX experience (no doubt). The explosions were awesome etc, however, where Dune 2 disappointed me was:
(1) the fight scenes
(2) the bi-polar characters (specifically Bautista)(1) the group fight scenes (army battles etc) and what I'll refer to as the 'choreography' was poor, and you could see the actors waiting to be struck and it looked fake and ruined the credibility.(2) Bautista in Dune 1 was frightening and dark where in Dune 2 he was a blubbering idiot. Also, the role played by Austin was 'okay' but the fact he needed the shield to fight 3 crippled Atreidas was confusing to me cos if Austin's character is such a badass then...?My understanding of what is a 'Sci-Fi' has been changed, and from now on not only does it need 'technology' but also a 'higher level' of intelligence rather than a marketed/portrayed high level of intelligence.Also the element of comedy in Dune 2 (which I like but not in 'Sci-Fi's) made it into an 'Action/Adventure' and there were Indiana Jones vibes in part from the 'Yemen' (sorry, the 'Fremen'). Bardem was a few lines away from saying 'Indy'.In a nutshell Dune 1 was a dark and relatable movie. Spice = Oil etc etc. It was magnificent, and if Dune 1 = Batman Begins then Dune 2 = Batman & Robin.For me this is overrated. It is good but not very very good.Zendaya was good.Chalomet was good.Bardem was good.Ferguson was good.I wanted more and started falling asleep once the fight choreography ruined the credibility of what I expected to be a top top movie.",positive
230,"Dune Part 2, clocking in at over two hours, delivers a captivating cinematic experience. The stellar performances, meticulous plot execution, and awe-inspiring cinematography collectively contribute to an outstanding film. Each actor excels in their role, and the costume designs are commendable.While the movie shines in various aspects, it occasionally leans heavily on visual effects, reaching a point of excessiveness. Despite this, the overarching narrative brilliantly delves into the theme of religious fanaticism. The spiritual motifs in Dune draw striking parallels to messianic concepts, echoing the biblical narrative of Jesus and his mission to liberate humanity from tyranny over 2000 years ago in our world. Overall, Dune Part 2 successfully navigates the delicate balance between visual spectacle and profound storytelling, making it a noteworthy cinematic experience.",positive
231,"The movie was descent scifi and a FAIRLY good second part to the series. The character build wasgood but not great. The dialog left something to be desired as it was at times confusing if you didn't know the story. The cinematography was excellent.All that being said, I can't for the life of me understand why the writers and directors feel in today's world that they have to change the original story line. The modifications done actually did major changes to the story in a way that made it lose continuity and not make sense in parts. The leaving out of specific caracter interactions such Pauls sister killing the Baron and Paul's ability to use the 'voice' to say nothing of skiping the whole sonic weapon storyline was crazy. Chanti's lack of support for Paul's descision to marry Emperor's daughter was weird. Chani not having a son was also strange as it played a big part in Paul's descision making.All in all the tone and storyline of the second part was as if this was a totally different movie and story from the first part.",positive
232,"The film starts exactly at the moment the first part ended. Although according to Villeneuve it is designed to be understood without having seen the first part, I highly recommend watching Dune: Part One before.The first half of the film is poetic. Great shots of the desert. Developing new characters (especially Fremen) that we had seen briefly in the first part and, above all, we can see an evolution of some characters that we already knew. I highlight here the character of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), who undoubtedly gets one of the great performances of the film. Bravo to Villeneuve for having developed Chani's character (wasted in Herbert's novel), here Chani shines until the end. Bardem, is also a fundamental piece that gives freshness to the serious and majestic plot, adding dynamism and even funny moments.The second half of the film goes to Paul Atreides. I can't say too much here, only that we see one of the greatest evolutions of a character that I've been seen in cinema. The last 45 minutes of the film are simply some of the best I have ever witnessed on a screen. Everything that was harvested in Dune: Part One now makes complete sense. The characters of Florence Pugh and Austin Butler stand out, the first one, in the background but being a totally key character, especially for everything that is going to come (Messiah); and the second one for his excellent performance as a villain (far above the Baron, a villain who personally never convinced me).All of this is great, however, an element of equal importance to everything mentioned was: the music of Hans Zimmer. Spectacular songs and sounds that make you simply feel vibrate (literally... if you see it in Imax) every moment inside you. It is no coincidence that Nolan's best films have Zimmer's seal. His music creates art. His music creates blockbusters. Not because it's commercial, but because it creates emotions within you. Every note, sound and song are placed at the right time and moment in the film. Hans Zimmer's music is undoubtedly the specie, the Water of Life... of Dune: Part Two.With all this we are left with what is not only the best science fiction film ever created, but what is (be careful what I am going to say) the best film of this 21st century (at least to date), with permission from the Dark Knight and Interstellar.Villeneuve gives us a great masterpiece. Here, however, the Messiah is not Paul Atreides, nor Villeneuve himself... The Messiah is the spectator. You. This film will push you to be a better you, it will make you dream big, it will remind you that, like Paul, you can decide when to lead your life and inspire others. You are the Chosen One to, within a simple movie, find the Gold that will make you better in your daily life.This valuable lesson is not achieved by ordinary pieces of art, but only by a few works... which some of us dare to call... MASTERPIECES.Because... in the shadows of Arrakis lie one secret... Dune 2 is a MASTERPIECE.",positive
233,"I don't know what can you say about this movie that wasn't already said. Unbelievable cinematography, CGI, casting, fabulous music and villains. Villneuve did the impossible, adapt probably the hardest book ever in the S. F. universe. Part one was great but part two is FLAWLESS. Do yourself a favor and watch it in IMAX, seriously, you won't regret it.Who didn't read the books (I envy you, to be able to read it for the 1st time Ô£ø√º√≤√Ñ) may talk about minor issues with the script but the director was so faithful to the books and you don't see that in Hollywood nowadays. Of course, you can't cover and entire book in just 2 and a half hour of a movie, but he did it! Villneuve cements his place in the pantheon of top tier directors with this movie.I can't wait for part 3, I refuse to believe there won't be one, over the years he said his dream is to make a trilogy and close the circle.In the end, all I can say is go watch the movie, do it in IMAX and enjoy a mind-blowing journey, in one of the best movies ever done. Yes, it's that good!",positive
234,"Choosing not to watch this masterpiece is the greatest disservice you could do for yourself. This may be the greatest movie I have ever seen. As someone who has never had a vested interest in the world of Dune, I had my eyes opened in part 1, but Denis Villeneuve's sequel is nothing short of pure captivation. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack has not left my head since the movie began. The cinematography is some of the most visually stunning across such a variety of scenes. Austin Butler was an absolute force with the little screen time he had, a terrifying and psychotic villain that rivals some of the greats. Timothy Chalamet's command of attention of all was unmatched. The chants of ""Lisan al Gaib"" have replayed over and over in my head for the past day. I already have tickets to rewatch and will be shocked if that's the last time I see it.",positive
235,"Whoever says film is dead, show them this. I can't believe what I witnessed tonight.I'm not a big movie person I do love movies but haven't reviewed or criticized any of them. I just can't stop thinking about this movie how good every single actor did to portray their role.The way the director made sure everything was perfect, and just visually spectacular!I have nothing bad to say about this film, the sound was perfect the sights I noticed my eyes expand to their fullest at most of these scenes I had to remind myself to blink!I hate reviews like this because I feel others may feel I'm exaggerating, but watch this film for yourself and tell me I'm wrong!",positive
236,"So. Frank Herbert told a story of religious fervor and how it warps the minds of people. Dennis Villeneuve wanted to capture it and did so very well.With this film Villeneuve creates a grand tapestry of cultural expression which we have never seen before. The different planets have their very distinct feel to them, in both sight and sound and one never feels like it's too much or too weird, it's just the right amount. Villeneuve managed to capture and create his own totality of the world of Dune. Some could say he leaves certain parts of the book out which they miss, but just as with Peter Jacksons trilogy, this movie eminates a passion from both director, cinematographer, composer, vfx artists, sound designers, it's clear they wanted to tell Frank Herberts story, and they certainly did!Hollywood is in a crisis, why? Just because people have stopped going to the movie theatres? Well, as we see with this movie which has already broken many box office records, people haven't necessarily stopped going to the cinema, they just don't wanna waste money on bad movies. So the Hollywood crisis is, sure, partly due to technological change, but also to a severe lack of good stories to tell. And funnily enough, the lack of stories to tell in 2024 has a parallel to the story of Dune 2, mainly in that the prophet of Paul Atreides is precisly the story the Fremen need to reach beyond the dunes and out into the galaxy, we need a similar story to reach beyond ourselves today too. But as Dennis Villeneuve and Frank Herbert so brilliantly shows us, it can very easily go bad.I tell you though. When watching this film, you cannot help yourself, you are just dragged along whether you want to or not. Chalamet, Bardem, Ferguson, Zendaya, Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd, Butler they all do their parts so well. I would say Zendaya has a tendency to be in the permanent ""I carelessly dissaprove""-role, but even she manages to break out of it for this movie.The thing that impressed me the most is the authenticity of the different cultural expressions as I mentioned before, the Harkonnen aestethics, the choice of having a black and white sun, the Fremen funeral rite, the accuracy of shamanic rituals, the costumes, it all feels like a window into a different reality more than a movie.I have blabbed on, what could have been said in just a few words, so here it goes in case I wasn't clear: This is an amazing movie!",positive
237,"Dune Part 2 is an absolute marvel of a movie, and Zendaya's performance as Chani is just magical. She brings such depth and emotion to the character, making Chani feel like a real person you can root for and connect with. Her chemistry with Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet is off the charts, and you can feel the tension and tenderness between them in every scene they share.Zendaya's presence on screen is captivating, and you can't help but be drawn into her world. She's not just an actress playing a role; she becomes Chani, embodying her strength, courage, and vulnerability in a way that's truly inspiring.And let's not forget the rest of the movie - the visuals, the storytelling, everything is just top-notch. Director Denis Villeneuve has created a breathtaking world that feels both epic and intimate, and Zendaya's performance is a shining beacon in the midst of it all.Overall, Dune Part 2 is a cinematic experience you won't soon forget, and Zendaya's talent and charisma only add to its brilliance. She's truly one of the brightest stars in Hollywood right now, and I can't wait to see what she does next.",neutral
238,"I loved the first movie. What happened with the second? For those who read the books.First, what happened to the Space Guild Navigators? One of the main plots is that the Space Guild Navigators need spice to fold space and allow travel between the systems. No where to be found in this movie. So, for those who didn't read the books. Spice comes across as a drug used like cocaine in the movie. You have no sense of urgency because if the ""Spice must flow"" is stopped. It's the end of the empire.Second, what a waste of of Christopher Walken. He comes across as the enfeebled emperor of the houses. The urgency for the emperor going to Dune is because he doesn't want Paul to tell the other houses about his betrayal? WHAT? I guess since you didn't bring in the Space Guild Navigators you had to invent another reason? Did Christopher's contract stipulate that he only wears robes or did they run out of money for his costumes? At the end of movie he looks like a homeless person walked on set. What was also missing was the pressure by the Witches and the Space Guild on the emperor to continue with spice production. Christopher was less menacing and more like 'Grandpa' needs to go to the memory care facility.Third, I knew the movie was in trouble when I looked at my watch and realized ""There's only nine minutes left in this move, how are they going to end it?"". I felt the movie was rushed to reach a conclusion and the ending battle was chaotic and short. Chaotic in not a good way. There is a whole scene about 'the atomics' that made me question on why is it in the movie? We are told about the 'atomics', but there is no follow-up to the ending battle. The fierce emperor warriors come across as incompetent wimps. The ending seemed way to rushed. It's less about a powerful emperor and more like 'how did none of the other houses not take him out?'.There are other problems that are pretty minor, like nothing is mentioned at all about the other systems. Like the Mentat's or the planet of machines. Too much time spent on 'Fade' killing people in an Arena, but failing to mention who these characters are. If you hadn't seen the first film, there deaths make no sense. Robands death seemed like an after thought. Like we need to get rid of this character, but the movie is going on too long. But, my primary complaint is the lack of 'Space Guild Navigators"" and why Spice is so important to these people. There seems to be no urgency by any of the characters to make sure ""The Spice Must Flow"". Disappointed.",positive
239,"Dune: Part II is a film of superlatives, simply phenomenal. Introduced by the guttural spoken prayer of the Sardaukar priests familiar from the first part, the second scene once again leads into the vastness of the desert and the spherical sounds while watching the grains of sand flying over the desert ceiling herald the epic start of the following two and a half hours.With Dune: Part II, the best in their field come together to film what is largely unfilmable. Added to this is Villeneuve and Zimmer's personal dedication to the original book and their close collaboration with Herbert's descendants. What's really brilliant is that the film succeeds in explaining the very complex history of the universe, which even in the books cannot be understood without a glossary, in such a way that the inexperienced viewer understands the plot coherently and the experienced viewer recognises the subtle allusions. The usual challenges of science fiction films are solved well, some questions are simply not allowed to be asked, as is typical of the genre (such as how to descend from Shai-Hulud - analogous to: Why didn't the eagles fly to Mordor?). Anyone who is petty here does not understand the metaphor of fantasy.From the very first minute, you are captivated by this galaxy created by Herbert, which Villeneuve and Fraser (and many others) design with visual magnificence, supported by the inimitable acoustic support from Zimmer. The entire film crew pushed themselves to their limits, and sometimes you only recognise the masterly craftsmanship at second glance (my third cinema is at doorstep, still counting). Just to mention the infrared scene on Giedi Prime, the novel and different sounds of the various planets, the voice of Loire Cotler, the performance of the (real) actors in the (real) desert, the clever use of mass psychological rhetoric and the entire costume and set design.The film is a holistic work of art whose atmosphere and pathos simply overwhelm me and either leave me speechless or elicit minutes of praise. But it could be a little longer, because so much is only hinted at.Yet: My favourite film.",positive
240,"This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¬¨√¶ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",positive
241,"What is it about screenwriters that makes them believe they can rewrite a story better than the original author ? The visuals are stunning in this film and it would have been exceptional if not for the departure from the original writing. As a result the story became shallow and yet another burning torch for gender equality in film, What a Shame . If you have read the books you would know that Chani's character for example is a complete departure in this film . The character backstories in some cases are non existent. I pity the new generation of film goers who watch this without ever having read the books as they are missing out on a truly great story .",positive
242,"I loved the first movie, even though it slowly built the plot I am familiar with all the dune books and was happy with how it was done. This second movie though is on another level altogether. Just been to the cinema to see it with friends and we were all overwhelmed, definitely this will be the best movie of this year, maybe of this decade. Some slight changes from the books but I can understand why they were made and I think they add to the film.This is a complex film that works on so many levels. All of us would happily have watched it again immediately, there are so many small details and elements to love.Do yourself a favour and go to the conema and see this.I think the third film may not be so good as the third book not so great, being set 12 years after the ending of part 2 when paul is on power for some time, but I am still looking forward to it.People are comparing this film to Dark Night and Empire strikes back. That is not Hype, I agree. Despite game of thrones being inspired by Frank Herberts Dune and sharing many themes, and despite similarities used by Lucas in Star Wars, if anything the plot elements work even better here in the priginal.",positive
243,"I watched the movie on the premier day in IMAX and i was completely stunned by the movie, it is by far the best movie i have watched. The music, the sounds, the costumes, the acting, the costumes, the character development is absolutely amazing. I just watched the movie for a second time in a regular '' family friendly'' cinema and i just have to say that the expereince wasnt the same. I still got the chills but the intensity you get from this movie in IMAX is not comparable to anything i have ever seen. I cannot urge you enough to watch this in imax and be prepared to get addictet to what is IMO the best movie off all time :)",positive
244,"It is such a relief to finally see a movie on the scale of the Dark Knight or other greats.The acting, direction, sound design, score and visuals are top class and all come together to complete a modern epic.Sure some of the book purests will disdain the film for verging of the some of the original narrative and others who thought Dune 1 was boring will probably think the same for this.This movie significantly expands the first movie, while having some of the most intense action scenes I have seen. Plus the political and religious undertones advance the storyline so much more than anything Star Wars could have envisioned..guess it's only fair since Dune influenced Star Wars. And if you are a fan of Game of Thrones this will be right up your alley!But overall this is a special masterful moment in movie making and Sci-fi. Bring on Dune Messiah!",positive
245,"I love it. There's something special about this cinematic experience that brings back the nostalgia of the early 2000s when the best movies came out. It's a time when anticipation built up for months, if not years, before a major film's release. I particularly enjoy that it's once again similar like back in the days when you were genuinely excited to await a movie's release. The kind of excitement that had you marking calendars and planning movie nights with friends or family. As a hard-working man, finding joy in such simple pleasures has become rare. I can enjoy a trilogy again as if I were a fan, just like in the old days, finding myself in a world so vast and stories so compelling that for a moment, the outside world fades away. It makes me feel young again, reigniting the sense of wonder and endless possibility I had back then. This movie is brilliant, not just in its execution but in its vision. I love how they incorporated Islamic prophecies. It's a testament to the film's commitment to not just entertain but to educate. And I believe this movie is more than just fiction and entertainment; it's the future.",positive
246,"Dune Part 2 is nothing short of a spectacular cinematic experience. The score is on another level. Hans Zimmer takes what you already know and makes it even more impactful. You have to experience it on big screen with sounds completely overflowing and captivating you. The cast is simply perfect. Unforgettable performances from Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem and Timothee Chalamet. As a huge fan of the books, I say they made them justice! This is a fantastic adaptation of Frank Herbert's world. Whatever they changed, they did a good job with it and it all makes sense. Some things just wouldn't work on screen and you all know it.

247,"This movie is just fun to watch. All the details give the fremen a soul.Yes, it left some stuff from the book out, but it also added things.You can see the true nature of the fremen apart from fierce fighting. Female characters like Lady Jessica and Chani gain importance which they really deserve. Due to the movies rather slow pace you can really feel how Fremen Fanatics draw Paul out to be their Messiah and through Chani and Paul you can see that they initially don't need a white male savior, because they are strong themselves.Outside of Arrakis however you see how much Paul Muad D'ib is underestimated. They already try to find another puppet for their game: Feyd Rautha. A total mad man who really shows his sardistic side.The movie is an homage to the books. Each actor portrayals their role beautifully so that they feel really like their character.The cinematography obviously is a special touch; a feeling of amazement and passion for Arrakis.The score only adds to that; makes you feel the world.In my eyes it is perfect to understand and just cool.Avoiding the difficulties in portraying Alia by just postponing her birth. Cutting the space guild, cutting Hawat Turfirs little Arc or the intrigues of The Baron and the Na-Baron. All of these things gave more space to the fremen. And that REALLY paid out.",neutral
248,"Dune: Part Two comes out in a historic moment where world feel the need of a new Kolossal movie while every other big scale franchises are dooming.Unfortunately Paul's epic tale suffers of incredibly slow pacing cuts and slow character building sequences. Imagine it takes one hour to get out of the ""become the messiah"" chapter. I liked the direction and the choice to cut meaningless chatting over a bigger direction with the world showing the events. Dialogues are often over filled with high fantasy terms and nomenclatures which I'm sure will lose the audience many times before you understand you don't actually need to understand what they mean to get the bigger picture.Casting is probably one of the greatest I have ever seen with many having just a few lines of dialogues and/or not feeling invested in the characters they are portraying.I can't stand Bautista to be the main villain for the first part of such a movie...Just to be replaced by a random dude with no charm that does a badass show-off for 5 minutes and become our tier S final boss.World wants Villeneuve to be the new Peter Jackson so hard with articles and adv everywhere over the Net calling it the new 'Empire Strikes Back' but this Dune is a poor contender when put in comparison to any Lord of the Rings.",positive
249,"Dune Part Two masterfully continues the epic saga, seamlessly blending spectacle with profound storytelling. Denis Villeneuve's direction remains impeccable, capturing the essence of Frank Herbert's universe. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides deepens, navigating complexities with skill. The visuals astound, matched by Hans Zimmer's evocative score. A gripping sequel that elevates the sci-fi genre. And personally I can't wait three more years for part three, because this could be my favorite movie ever. One thing is absolutely sure. Dune part two is a better movie than the empire strikes back.",neutral
250,"""Dune: Part Two,"" the highly anticipated continuation of Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic novel, builds on the foundation set by its predecessor. The film picks up the story of Paul Atreides (Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet) as he navigates the treacherous political landscape of Arrakis while embracing his destiny among the Fremen.Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterpiece. Villeneuve's direction, combined with Greig Fraser's breathtaking cinematography, immerses viewers in the vast, unforgiving desert landscapes and the intricate, otherworldly design of the Dune universe. The special effects are seamless, bringing the sandworms and the unique technology of Herbert's world to life with stunning realism.The performances are strong across the board, with Chalamet delivering a compelling portrayal of Paul's growth and struggle. Zendaya's expanded role as Chani adds depth to the narrative, and the supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac, continue to shine.However, the film's pacing can be uneven, and its complex plot might be challenging for those unfamiliar with the source material. Despite these issues, ""Dune: Part Two"" is an ambitious and visually arresting film that successfully continues the epic saga. It's a must-watch for fans of the genre and the original novel.",neutral
251,"Dune Part 2! Here to accept the award is director Denis Villeneuve!Denis, tell us, what was your goal for this movie?Well, I wanted to make another movie with lots of sand in it. Many sands! Much cinematography!And how did you see the story progressing from the first movie?Well, there needed to be more sand! Sand, and giant worms, of course!What do you say to those who criticize the use of spice as a stand-in for today's drug problems?Well, I wanted, as well as the sand, for there to be chemistry in the film - spice chemistry! So, of course, I had to make sure there was no chemistry between the two main actors that might have overshadowed that.Some have said that the film is overly long and badly paced. Can you comment?Well, sand can't be rushed! As for pacing, well I certainly did a lot of that in the editing room!And what of Hans Zimmer's ""interesting"" score?Well, it was magnificent! Who doesn't like an obvious tribal theme with lots of wailing voices that make no sense?Some complain it is boring. Thoughts?Well, the worms certainly bore through the sand! Did you see that? Many worms, much sand!There are those that say you cherry-picked things from the book and didn't follow the original story accurately?Well... There was a book?Okay, well, thank you for your time Mr Villeneuve. Enjoy your win!Well, I think I shall!SUMMARY: Sand. Spice. No chemistry. Some action. 40 minutes of unecessary footage that could have been cut. By the time Part 3 comes out you will have forgotten this - don't be tempted to re-watch it.",negative
252,"From start to finish I was enthralled by the visual experience! Emotionally I was engaged. I was immersed in the world of Dune and I definitely want this story to continue to be told through the next book. Denis Villenueve has to be at the helm if they make more. The cinematography by Greg Frazier is awe inspiring. The acting is phenomenal. Hans Zimmer killed it with the score. When the movie ended I was not ready to be done. I wanted more. It was a glorious cinematic experience.Knowing the book material and growing up with the 1984 movie, my only hang ups are on some of the choices of what was left out or changed. I know not everything can fit into the movie but I'm still digesting the changes. Like I said it was an enthralling experience and in some ways they found a very stripped down way of portraying just enough that I'm not disappointed. But I want more! But I do stand by this adaptation of part 1 and now part 2.""He who controls the spice controls the Universe""",neutral
253,"This is one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. When I watch modern films I am often turned off by the poorly thought-out story, contemporary political issues and extremely inappropriate humor and swearing. This is a film adaptation of a story that is unfamiliar to me. Well... they got a fan. It's not so much the story that impresses me, but the whole antourage surrounding it is phenomenal. The soundstage & music together in combination with everything on the screen is something you almost never see. This was a very special experience in the cinema. Extremely well done. I can't wait for the 3rd part!",positive

It deserves all the Oscars this year.When I went to the cinema for the first time, I received very positive emotions. When I went for the second time, it seemed to me that the film sags a little during the second act, but at the same time the last hour looks very good. When I went for the third time, I did not notice any flaws , the third time I watched it with maximum pleasure. I have already bought a ticket to go for the fourth time. I want to note especially the love line of Paul and Chani, I was moved to the bones. Also, the Music, it is simply incredible, I am extremely delighted with the fact that , what Hans Zammer wrote for this film, great work. Go to the cinema and enjoy, if possible better in IMAX)",positive
255,"It's truly refreshing to experience a big-budget blockbuster in theaters where the director is given creative freedom without being suffocated by studio interference.Denis Villeneuve was clearly able to bring his vision to life in this second installment of 'DUNE,' and what a success it is. Similar to the first film, the sound and visuals are stunning, with the colors in many scenes leaving me utterly speechless.This movie features significantly more action and fighting, which is understandable given that the first film focused on establishing the environment and explaining the world of 'DUNE.'I particularly appreciated how Paul's visions were integrated into the story, as well as the exploration of the various religious themes without giving away spoilers. Although I haven't read the book, I felt that Villeneuve did an excellent job of translating the complex themes from the source material onto the screen.",positive
256,I found myself on numerous occasions during the film sat open mouthed and mesmerised like a 4 year old boy. I came out wanting to watch it again and again. I'm known to not get excited by anything but this had my neck hairs stood to attention frequently.Anyone who says this film is a slow starter really doesn't know what they are talking about. The casting was spot on and they actors delivered and some.It reminded me as a 7 year old watching Star Wars for the first time at the cinema with my mum I was that enthralled with the whole experience. I was gripped and submerged in the action scenes as if I was there.,neutral
257,"This one is truly special! Mr. Villeneuve is delivering yet another spectacular movie, following the also very good part one. As other reviewers have mentioned, part two is more complex as we are witnessing the evolution of Paul Atreides to a fierce leader of an entire nation.All actors bring their ""A"" game and are delivering artfully the vision of their director.The visual and sound effects together with the cinematography is ground breaking as well. Everything is just made as it should for the viewer to be transported to the realm of Dune! An instant classic in my opinion and a huge congratulations to everyone involved!",positive
258,"Opening for part three? Most important parts of the story are in 15min of the 166min movie!? Unexplained and vague. Unconvincing characters. First part was excellent unlike this one. For someone who is fan of the book and David Lynch Dina from 1984 this is big disappointment. His transformation was covered in 5min. From taking his position as rebel leader to conqueror of the universe in 15min... Love story is. The love story is unconvincing and without any chemistry between the two leading characters. All in all, a big disappointment after the successful and good first part. You can watch this film at home with no problem.",positive
259,"I was lucky enough to catch the IMAX prerelease and left stunned and shocked by how good it was. The imagery created in this movie was beyond anything I had ever imagined while reading the book. The visual storytelling and world building beautifully condenses so much of Herbert's writing to focus on romance, revenge, betrayal, fundamentalism and transcendence. It is a different ride than part one. I won't provide any spoilers, but here are a few other random thoughts.I got a kick out of the brief but genuinely appreciative intro recorded for the special IMAX showing. I hope they start doing more of these. Hopefully it will get movie fans back in packed theaters because Dune: Part Two is an experience in IMAX that made the story better that I can't get at home. I love watching movies at home with subtitles, but I would have missed a lot visually if I focused on reading those.I left the theater somewhat overwhelmed by not just the IMAX technology and pace of storytelling, but also the parallels with current events of religious fundamentalism rebelling against corrupt, evil powers focused on maximizing wealth. The fact the movie packed in that much in under three hours was an achievement. I'm looking forward to rereading Herbert's books again.",positive
260,"To be succinct, my issue with this movie is that many of the most interesting, clever, and unique story features that makes Dune so iconic were oversimplified and/or completely changed to make a very generic story that does not mirror the book in most any respect. Sitting in the theater, having only just finished my re-reading of Dune the day before, I realized that only about 20% of the movies material were scenes from the novel and even still scene were taken in a completely different context. The characters are simply not the same characters from the novel, but even more than that they are not the same as the first part and that is apparent from their inconsistent motivations. Overall, the movie is not bad. I give it 5 out of 10 because it is a generic, middle of the pack movie. Which is even more upsetting when paired with the knowledge that following the plot of the already established novel would have provided a much higher score. Quite disappointing.",negative
261,"Dune Part Two (2024)"" had all the ingredients for greatness, yet it falls tragically short. As a devout fan of Frank Herbert's epic saga, I approached this sequel with high hopes, only to be met with profound disappointment.The most glaring flaw lies in its butchered storytelling. The intricate plot of Herbert's masterpiece is treated with a careless disregard, resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative. Instead of delving into the depth and complexity of the source material, the film meanders through superfluous scenes that add little to the overarching story.Where the1984 Dune adaptation succeeded was in its faithful and nuanced storytelling. Each scene served a purpose, advancing the plot and deepening our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The pacing was deliberate, allowing viewers to immerse themselves fully in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe.In contrast, ""Dune Part Two"" feels like a series of missed opportunities. Important plot points are glossed over or omitted entirely, leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied. Characters lack depth and development, reducing them to mere caricatures of their literary counterparts.While the visuals are undoubtedly stunning and the performances commendable, they cannot compensate for the film's fundamental narrative shortcomings. ""Dune Part Two"" is a prime example of style over substance, a hollow shell of what could have been a truly remarkable cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Dune Part Two"" fails spectacularly in capturing the essence of Herbert's masterpiece. Its rushed plot and inclusion of unnecessary scenes detract from the overall experience, leaving audiences longing for the depth and nuance of the original 1984 adaptation.",positive
262,"This is the kind of cinema you only get to see one or twice in a decade.And we were fortunate enough to see 3 great movies in first half of this decade.Oppenheimer, The way of the water and dune part 2.Absolutely Phenomenal.It is great from character development to screen time of all the actor does not dissappoint at all, everything was well planned and certainly dune is going to bag all the awards this year.This type of cinema compels us to write about it and certainly make everyone aware about a delightful experiance.I an hopeful that Dune part 2 becomes a profitable venture se that we can se more of it coming in the future.",positive
263,"Just got back from the cinema after watching this masterpiece. This and the first part are the only two films I've paid the mortgage to go and see in a large screen and they absolutely need and deserve to be seen. This takes all of the expectations I had from the first part of Dune and exceeded them ten-fold. There are some decisions made by Denis Villeneuve which are so jaw droppingly exquisite I'm not sure exactly how his announced rendition of Dune Messiah is going to have any room left to improve upon this. This is a beautiful beautiful film which builds on itself, and special mention must go to the sound design which literally shook my seat in the cinema. Perfect.",neutral
264,I must say that this definitely lived up to my expectations. It gave me goosebumps at least a half a dozen times. A must to watch on the biggest screen you can get to at the cinema. As with the first you leave your seat crying I want more...more...more!!!! So very very good. One of my favourite things about the film is the belief in all the characters. There's a twist which I didn't see coming but I was pleasantly surprised and it added to the overall story. The fight scenes are awesome. The baddies are truly cruel and you definitely route for the good guys. In a nutshell to ALL Sci-fi fans go.,positive
265,"I am not a person that goes to the movies. I much prefer the comfort of my own home and my own amenities. After watching, the admittedly slow but large in scale, first film of this adaptation, my wife and I were convinced that we MUST see the follow-up in theaters. We were not disappointed.This movie made me feel the way people from the era of Star Wars describe what it was like to see the original trilogy in theaters. I spent the majority of the movie awestruck with my mouth agape.People will formulate their own opinions about the content of the film versus the book, but simply as an in-theater experience. This film is nearly flawless in every imaginable way. The sounds can be both subtle and booming, the visuals are breathtaking in nearly every single scene, the special effects are absolutely top notch and the acting is stellar AT WORST.I do NOT typically enjoy paying too much for snacks and being stuck in a moderately comfy seat for hours on end, but this is a movie worth giving up any comfort you might have at home to see in a theater. Do yourself a favor and see it.",negative
266,"What an absolute masterpiece .The one thing that's important for me when I watch a movie is the ability of the filmmaker to make you watch the movie without blinking and I have some regrets for blinking my eyes and I missed so many great seconds of the movie because I couldn't keep my eyes open for almost 3 hours but if I have to choose a movie and have the ability to watch it without blinking It's going to be this one.The movie shows the masterclass of a director that his movies do not fail you.I think this franchise shows the best work of the new generation actors alongside the old ones with one the best directors.This movie is powerful in every way. The music is outstanding and I don't think without Hans Zimmer it was possible . The music is atmospheric and it gives the ability to audience to feel the moments .The story is phenomena but we have to stand up and praise for Denis Villeneuve because of his perfect adaptation.And the cinematography.I'm Speechless
It's something only for eyes and I can't describe it with words.At the end it's the perfect movie made for cinemas and define the word CINEMA with it .Denis Villeneuve at his peak.",positive
267,"For transparency, I had no intention of writing a review. I read the books and loved the first movie so I had a feeling I'd like the 2nd film. And I loved it. But what really had me wanting to contribute is the 1 star reviews. I love them so much. So much anger and vitriol over a movie. Everything I loved about this move seems to be what they hate. It was long but thick with character development. The fight scenes were there for the plot only and didn't make me fall asleep to 30 mins of cgi superhero action. Instead it furthers the plot. It wasn't action packed but layers of lore and story building.But the rage from the reviews of slow action, boring characters, ""lame"" sci-fi makes me laugh and worry. This is epic storytelling, not force fed action. You will have to have an attention span that can focus more than a few minutes at a time. If you can break the cycle of needing non stop stimulation and instead melt into a rich deep story with world building and character arch, you don't be disappointed. Obviously not for everyone but what is. But one of the best film (franchises) I've seen in years. Truly hoping to see the full arch of Paul's story with a 3rd.",positive
268,"Yes, it's good, but is is great?. I absolutely loved the first film and couldn't wait for the second. The landscapes, the cinematography, the costumes all incredible. But it just feels like it was trying too hard, the script was so cheesy at times, I didn't feel any connections to the characters or what they were going through. Chani and Paul's relationship didn't seem believable and it just appeared. There was no build up, and too much comedy (?!!) there were people laughing in the cinema when I went, I didnt go to watch a comedy and the apparent funny bits shoukd have been left out. Maybe there was too much crammed into this second part.",positive
269,"This movie has everything. And all those big actors in one movie, have not seen that in a while. The movie was powerfull with the dynamic music in the background. The story was building up towards the climax. Loved the slowmotion scenes. The scenes with Butler are one of the best...Timothe does not disapoint. Happy and proud to see a swedish actress in such a big movie and Rebecca was actually good.I would have love the movie to be 2 hours and not 2 hours and 45 but since it was so good I could accept it. What a Messiah we got.Zendaya was great and loved Bardiem as always. Desert scenes were topnotch.",positive
270,"The film enchants with its breathtaking cinematography, stirring music (I love Zimmer), and immersive sound design, constructing a vibrant cinematic universe. While the talented cast delivers commendable performances and certain scenes are genuinely captivating, I struggled to form a deep connection with the main characters, and the narrative lacked the compelling grip I anticipated. Overall, it's a commendable effort, yet it lacks the magical allure and goosebump-inducing moments. Compared to the director's previous work on Blade Runner 2049, this falls slightly short. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10.",positive
271,"I tried not to feel conditioned by the hype around this movie, but I was quite dissapointed after watching it.After a superb part one, which was a magical exhibition of cinema and an aesthetic pleasure, this second part is quite pretentious. Looks like the style exercise of an artist in love with himself, and seems that the story is a secondary factor here.It is like, ""ok, did you like the scenes of the thumper calling the sandworm?, here you have like twenty scenes of a thumper calling sandworms, and even a scene with twenty thumpers calling sandworms at the same time; did you like the beautiful faces of Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson in the desert, with great Hans Zimmer music?, ok, here you have fifty seven shots of the beautiful faces in dramatic moments of all the extremely pretty actresses we have been able to recruit for this"". The problem is that quantity does not compensate for the loss of the surprise effect.In fact, the story is just an excuse for an interminable exhibition of close-ups of the incredibly beautiful faces of the female cast, no less beautiful desert sceneries, and an interminable succession of sand worm ridings.Flat and hollow aesthetics, with a really poor storytelling. The story is confusing, with a first act focused in the Fremen, but with no real advance of the story, just Fremen in the desert, Fremen worshiping the mesiah, Fremen riding worms, worshiping again, Chani frowning at the inmensity of the desert with deep music, and so on (actually, Chani spent all movie frowning). Actually, the first act was terribly boring.Then, the abuse of ellipsis makes the story rush forward, to the point of losing sense sometimes. It is really difficult to follow it without any previous knowledge of what happened in the original novel.This rush lead to weird situations, as when suddenly Chani shows up out from nowhere in a ornithopter, and you ask yourself why and how she ended flying that thing.The rush to close the story causes the last act to be resolved hastily and sloppily. The expected final battle is resolved very quick and lacking epic and glory. The supposedly powerful and fearsome Sardaukar appears in the last battle as a few random guys without any combat abilities. The formerly powerful emperor and Harkonnen, are now weak and do not stand a chance against the new dark mesiah and their fundamentalist troops.Overall, the movie lost all the magic and mistery of the first part, and it is just an exhibition of style from a director that seems to be more in love with himself than with the story he is telling.About acting, all the cast are doing a great job. Special mention to the superb Javier Bardem, who, together with Zendaya, support all the movie on their shoulders. All the Harkonnen are doing a great job and are the most interesting characters, both in acting and aesthetically. To me, Paul Atreides is the worst part, plain and lacking substance and the you could expect from the leader of a holy war against a galactic empire.In summary, a pretentious sequel larguely inferior to the first part in all aspects.",positive
272,"Dune: Part Two!!!Outstanding movie, with a lot of character building and some major plot twists. The story is so complex, yet easy to understand. It will take you deep in to desert and reveal many secrets Arrakis has to offer.If you watch closely and inspect every detail the screen presents to you, you will find yourself to be taken down to a path through the history of Fremen and our own.There are no words to describe the feeling i got everytime the music started. Hats off Mr. Hans Zimmer, you surprise every time. And ofcourse an applause for Mr. Denis Villeneuve and all the cast for presenting such a wonderful experience.If you have a problem with my opinion, duel me in a hand-to-hand melee and let the best win.",positive
273,"**A Cinematic Triumph: Exploring the Epic Sequel ""Dune: Part Two""**""Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, building upon the foundations laid by its predecessor to deliver an epic saga that surpasses all expectations. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel transports viewers back to the mesmerizing world of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism on an unprecedented scale.From the outset, it is evident that ""Dune: Part Two"" is a labor of love, meticulously crafted with an unwavering commitment to honoring Frank Herbert's iconic source material. The film picks up seamlessly where its predecessor left off, plunging viewers into a world on the brink of war as the battle for control of Arrakis intensifies.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its masterful storytelling. Villeneuve deftly navigates the intricate narrative threads, balancing exposition with heart-pounding action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Each character is given ample room to grow and evolve, their motivations and conflicts explored with depth and nuance. Whether it's the charismatic Paul Atreides grappling with his destiny as the prophesied messiah or the enigmatic Lady Jessica torn between loyalty to her son and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, every character feels fully realized and essential to the story's unfolding drama.Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping vistas of Arrakis, brought to life with stunning practical and visual effects, serve as a mesmerizing backdrop for the film's epic narrative. From the towering sandworms that roam the desert to the intricately designed fremen sietches, every aspect of the world-building is executed with meticulous attention to detail, immersing viewers in a universe that feels both fantastical and eerily familiar.At the heart of the film lies its exceptional ensemble cast, led by the incomparable performances of Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to the role of Paul Atreides, capturing the character's internal struggle with poise and conviction. Ferguson, meanwhile, delivers a standout performance as Lady Jessica, infusing the character with a complexity and strength that elevates her beyond the typical archetype of the genre.Supporting performances from the likes of Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem further enrich the film's tapestry, each actor bringing depth and gravitas to their respective roles. Whether it's Isaac's portrayal of the noble Duke Leto Atreides or Bardem's charismatic turn as the fremen leader Stilgar, every character leaves a lasting impression, contributing to the film's rich and immersive world.Yet, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of ""Dune: Part Two"" is its thematic depth. Beneath its epic spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, religion, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. As the various factions vie for control of Arrakis, the film forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of power. It's a timely and thought-provoking commentary that resonates long after the credits roll, inviting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions in an increasingly complex world.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" stands as a triumphant achievement in modern cinema, a sprawling epic that dazzles the senses while challenging the mind. With its masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the preeminent filmmakers of our time. For fans of science fiction and cinema alike, ""Dune: Part Two"" is an experience not to be missed-an unforgettable journey to the heart of Arrakis and beyond.",positive
274,Dune Part Two is an outstanding sequel that greatly outshines Dune Part One in every single way. This film is definitely made to be seen in the cinema as the outstanding visuals translate amazingly onto the big screen. The music of this film is absolutely amazing and in my opinion it's one of the best soundtracks ever made. The story is gripping as it is fascinating and fantastic to see the rise of Paul Atreides . This film series seems to definitely be the Lord Of The Rings of the 2020s and it will be praised for generations. Overall a perfect film that I hope will preform well in awards season.,positive

Oh my goodness I mean like wow, let me just say Austin scared me I couldn't look him in the eye when I saw him and his voice was very creepy but captivated and his voice sounded like video game character kinda of and also some Stellan in his voice as well, I love this movie it was amazing so much wonderful work for Denis, You need to run not walk to watch dune 2 in March YES!Go see part 2 in theaters March 1st! Austin performance captivating, outstanding, menacing, creepy, and will having you want to see his performance even more. Also Austin was scarier and more menacing and twisted then when he was Tex Waston and more I feel like both are kind of equal but Austin in dune was insane and I would love to watch it over again.

276,"After watching the ""Dune 2 full movie"", I can confidently say that it is a spectacle that captivates from the first minute to the last. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film expands the story on the mysterious planet Arrakis in an epic and engaging way. Well-executed special effects, a deep storyline, and outstanding acting make this film a true masterpiece of science fiction cinema. The emotions, intrigues, and unforgettable adventures make ""Dune 2"" a must-see for fans of the genre. Extraordinary scenes, a mysterious atmosphere, and excellent music create unforgettable cinematic experiences. This production will surely stay in memory long after the screening.",positive
277,"This really isn't a Dune-the-book movie but a related tale that takes away all the sci-fi and deep intrigue that makes Dune-the-book such a fascinating tale. Instead what we get is super-stylized black-and-white with the details and the context rendered nearly superfluous in order to propel a simple tale of political ascension. Why is spice so important in use and action? What's the background that has set this whole conflict in motion? What's big deal about the worms? Why is Paul so reliant on the myths spread to ""pave the way"" versus his own abilities? Is Paul something special or not? Surely you've seen Dune I, now finding its natural continuation in Dune II which furthers the cause of gorgeous special effects, environmentals, sound, etc. But somehow it's all bland and as colorless as much of the landscape despite the spectacular costuming. Without context it's another ho-hum story of moderate manipulation that aims to succeed via Paul's riding the coattails of religious parable and meaningless miracles via a pushy Mom. P. S. Zendaya is only marginally better in D-II but far more annoying but T. C. has really grown up and greatly compensates for the overall plot dullness. My Oscar predictions: Every single technical award; in acting, nominations for Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson.",positive
278,OK so. I have been a Dune fan most of my life having read the book when I was little. Played the computer game. Watched the film. Re read the book before the films came out. Even read some of the later books but gave up on them and none stand up to the first book. Albeit children of dune is wothba read. Its really refreshing to have a movie improve on a book. OK they have not stuck to the plot 100 percent and are obviously planning a war of the great houses etc. Overall its everything I have ever wanted from Sci fi and cannot thank the people who have made this work so well enough. Seriously good. Bring on the next one. I really hope they can keep this up.,positive
279,"So for his final trial the soon-to-be Messiah has to traverse the desert coming across all sorts of dangers as explained to him thoroughly by Stilgar. ""Beware of the small ones, they are the most dangerous."" And off he goes, right? No! Instead: Cut to him walking alongside Chani in the dunes. Next scene he's with the fremens again. What happened here? Clearly some scenes are missing. Worse... it's never explained how he dealt with the trial.Besides that, there's a lot of build-up, over two hours, to a somewhat epic conclusion that is much too brief. And the main battle looked like it was lifted from Star Wars Attack of the Clones, only with better CGI.I found 'Dune part one' a masterpiece, but part two really didn't do it for me.",neutral
280,"I'm genuinely baffled why everyone felt this movie was so good. I've been a cinema fan for decades and in general a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve's other movies.This one felt like maybe the scope got away from him. It was certainly epic, but it felt hollow.It could have done away with quite a few battle scenes in favor for more interesting character development.They made many decisions to depart from the book, which is fine, but they felt like pointless decisions that made the characters less interesting. Maybe less likable.I'm blown away by how disappointed I am in this movie. I'll give it another watch or two in hopes it grows on me, but I'm struggling to see how it could.Maybe if they make Part Three based on Dune Messiah it will be better because there are less battles in that book to use as a crutch.If you want to see a bunch of people you barely know anything about stab each other for 3 hours. This is the movie for you.If you're looking for some contemplative sprawling sci-fi that tackles interesting subject matter, best look elsewhere.",positive
281,"This movie took my breath away. Saw an early release on an IMAX screen. Just wish I could see it again and again. I was worried it might get boring because of how long it was. That was FAR from the case. I was engaged throughout the film and on the edge of my seat at multiple times. The music, the acting, the costumes, cinematography- All so so so so good.*this is the part of the review where I don't have enough characters to post so I'm just going to ramble on. The movie was amazing. Go see it. It actually lives up to the hype and I cannot wait to see it again. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it.",positive
282,"""Dune 2"" continues the epic saga with breathtaking visuals and a gripping storyline. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, it delves deeper into the intricate politics and rich lore of the Dune universe. The performances are stellar, particularly from the talented ensemble cast led by Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya. The film masterfully balances spectacle with substance, delivering intense action sequences alongside thought-provoking themes of power, destiny, and sacrifice. While some may find its sprawling narrative daunting, fans of the genre will appreciate its ambition and attention to detail. ""Dune 2"" is a worthy sequel that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment.",neutral
283,"When i was watching this movie i felt really an happiness for the beauty and execution of this piece of art. I can easily say that at this point Dune part 2 is the most representative movie of all the art of Denis Villeneuve, it contains a lot of ispiration from 2001: a space odyssey and also from his pasts films like Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival. He did a perfect sequel for the first film that was also on point, but this one is more strong and we can see the beauty of the character and story development that leave us with the need of another sequel. Last thing but not for importance, the end of this film gived a sensation of excitement and curiosity for the future of this incredible saga.",neutral
284,"I just watched it at the Cinema and it was breathtaking, one of the best movies I've ever seen in theatre. Great acting, great story, great graphics, the music was beautiful, the fighting techniques, everything was on point. There's no part that is out of touch, nothing. I loved the first one and I was hyped for the second ( sometimes being too hyped results in dissapointment), but it was even better, it exceeded my expectations. I think this is Villenueve's best movie ever. I loved the development of the main charachter. I am waiting for the 3-rd which will complete this astonishing triology, I hope it will be as fantastic as DUNE PART 2.",positive
285,"Denis Villeneuve has set a new standard for how Sci Fi movies should be adapted and directed. There are few things to nitpick. Mostly to do with timeline and character transition. But when you understand it is being adapted to screen, it is near impossible to show a timeline which happens over few years. The art design, cinematography, vfx will set new gold standards. The cast and acting was stellar with a sprinkle of humour from Javier Bardem. Austin Butler, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken all were stellar as the new characters. Caught it at the Sunday Fan First Premiere. Going for a 2nd showing on March 1st at IMAX 70MM.",neutral
286,"This is the best theater experience I've had in a long time, maybe ever. There was an insane amount of hype behind this movie and I think it was worth every bit. Denis really did that. An impossible adaptation.There were changes from the book but I liked them all. Really smart, creative work-arounds. Breathtaking visuals. Stellar acting. Beautiful music.Did not feel like 3 hours. Just as with I watched the first movie, it was hitting its third act and I felt I'd only been watching for an hour, I didn't want it to end. I can only imagine what I missed on this first viewing. Easily placed amongst the ranks of greatest sequels of all time.",positive
287,"Both Dune 1 and 2 are epic, grandiose blockbusters. Masterful filmmaking obviously, visually, sound effects, music...it's an overwhelming - in a positive way - experience.But, I really hate to admit it...I liked Villeneuve's previous, older movies so much better. Prisoners for example, is a nailbiting, tense thriller that grabs you by the throat from the start, and doesn't let go.Arrival, Sicario same thing. And then I realized what it was...I felt more connected and invested in those main characters, emotionally.The only scene I felt an emotional connection, was Chani being jealous of Princess Irulan, when Paul asks Irulan's hand. That's it.I guess that's the challenge with making a film adaption of such epic proportions, it seems there's almost no time for 'real' character development...",positive
288,"What an intense ride this movie was! The story along the world building, acting and score drew me in from minute 1. This is what I loved about the first one and this is what I loved about this sequel! I would even say that this sequel was even more intense, more epic than the first one.Denis Villeneuve already has proven to me that he is a great SciFi director with Blade Runner: 2049 and Arrival but with Dune he shows that he is one of the greatest for me!If you liked Dune or SciFi in general, I think you have to watch this movie! I went to the biggest IMAX-screen in the world (Leonberg, Germany) and can only highly recommend to watch this movie on the biggest screen possible. This definitely is no movie you want to miss in cinema and have to watch at home!",positive
289,"This is just my opinion: the new Dune remakes are heartless pieces. The CGI and visuals, costumes, soundtrack, and everything is visually appealing, but wrong place wrong time to make this movie. Especially with everything happening in the Middle East.The acting was bland.These movies have no heart behind them. They are visually appealing and that is it. I don't get anything from these films; nothing about them sticks with me, and I truly believe (as a ND movie buff with an animation degree) these films will die in the year they were made.They're just like the Marvels films- fun/entertaining to see in theaters and will hype you up until the week after and the trend dies and everyone forgets and never speaks about it till the next one comes up.David Lynchs Dune is better and is more memorable, and has more art and heart in it.",neutral
290,"Hans Zimmer. Visually stunning. What could possibly be missing?This story has no depth. It is Anticlimactic at its best. Not sure what everyone is raving about. This story is so dull and boring with characters you care nothing about. They are shallow and lifeless. They might as well have been cardboard cutouts. They're not convincing and there is no feeling. It is literally 3 hours of visually and musically stunning footage. If that's your thing then I guess it's a great movie.Unfortunately for me, I like a good story. I like characters who reach into my heart and my mind. I like to be convinced they're the real deal. This was so disappointing I wish I could get my money and three hours of my life back. I hoped this second part would at least make up for the long driven out part of part one, but it is just more of the same.Where is the love between Channi and Paul? The only one who did any acting was Rebecca Ferguson, and she over-acted so much I was almost convinced she was trying to make up for the lack of depth in everyone else. Yet, Lady Jessica is supposed to be stoic. It's the director's vision, I suppose-mix it up so it comes across fresh.Speaking of fresh. How anticlimactic was that great uprising? I don't want to give anything away, but wow! Way to work your audience up for a surprise like that! I sure as heck didn't see that coming. I sneeze faster than that.I really have no idea how this load of garbage got so many rave reviews. It was terrible. Save yourself the money. Read the books or watch David Lynch's version. At least his wasn't drawn out for six boring hours.",positive
291,"This is the best movie I can ever remember seeing in recent times. So entertaining. Part one was solid, but this was outstanding. It had the perfect blend of comedy, action, drama, romance, everything. Beautiful cinematography and really good acting. I was a big fan of Star Wars as a kid and no movie has ever really given me that excited feeling I used to get when watching Star Wars in the theatre. This movie gave me that feeling. I don't know what else to say except watch this movie already. I've only seen it once but I plan to watch many more times. It 100% lived up to the hype. 10/10 go watch it!!",positive
292,"Just finished DUNE 2 with my son and I feel validated. This is the movie that we have waiting over 50 years to be made. Everything about was exactly as it should have been. Villenueve gave it the scale that it needed, while still making EVERY character fully fleshed out. Film making technology finally got to the point that could bring this story to life, and Denis Villenueve was there with his vision. I can only imagine Frank Herbert looking down from Heaven with a smile of approval.And 75% of the audience seemed to be older bald guys. They finally made one for the guys who were book nerds in the 70-80's.",neutral
293,"Movie is dense, alive, intense, the plot feels inevitable but not predictable. I know this sounds like I'm just throwing words out, but this is the kind of movie that makes you really sit and realize the power film as a medium can have.I remembered the first one enough, but I'm not a Dune superfan or anything. After watching this one though I feel like I should just watch them back to back to really soak it in. The glimpses of the inner politics (and of otherworldly things) is downright fascinating. Battle choreography fantastic, setpieces, fantastic.The only negatives I can think of is one particularly bad cgi wide shot which stuck out because everything else is immaculate, as well as one line from Chalamet that did not meet the quality of the performance of the veteran actor he said it to. (Maybe he felt he has to act up to him?l Anyways, great stuff, I'll see you all when Part 3 comes out in 2030.",positive
294,Denis Villeneuve did a perfect job in this movie in all aspects.. it was a product of 3 year effort that paid off really well ... His imagination about the world and different people was very beautiful.. cinematography was perfectly done and cgi as well ... Original score and the background music was spot on ... Fights also were magnificent... Timoth√© chalamet was phenomenal and Rebecca Ferguson spread fear in me by her acting ... Javier bardem never disappoints as usual ... Austin butler and florence pugh were good additions to the story .. and zendaya .. what a performance from her ... Stallen skarsgard was really unique characher ... And lastly josh brolin what a comeback in the story ... I can't wait to see the last chapter of the journey hoping it will be as perfect as dune 2 and wishing it to be better too .,positive
295,"Just saw a Marathon of part 1 and 2. I loved part 1, it has such a quiet, slow, philosophical feeling to it. The second one is more action, more pacy, woth fabulous charactersiations, part 1 was great but 2 is even so much better. I loved the funny delivery, many people laughed outloud in the cinema. Also the acting, the scenery, the music. A masterpiece. I also loved that there weren't prolonged sequences of fights or anything, in a way it's a movie of vignettes that are well executed, well conected and make logical and easy to follow story. And I speak it as a person that has not read the series. Finally, when I realised it's already the second part of the film and we are nearing the end, all I was able to think was, it's going to be a looooong wait for part 3. Because I want it here NOW, LOL.12/10 for me.",positive
296,"A great film that delves deeper into the characters, and more of a study piece here with our Characters. Who are wonderfully portrayed inside this film, I always new how talented the likes of Timothee S and Zendaya were, who arguably had there best performance here [Timothee Chalamet), although haven't seen Wonka.The futuristic style of the film is wonderful, so gorgeous and astetically pleasing on the eye. The effects are very good inside this film, and it's used effectively with the long range photographic image. So many wide shots which are tremendous, and as said look wonderful.And the film delves more into the human body and it makes it more interesting. Certainly the power elements with the 'revenge' plot which is a good way to expand the world and are characters, and makes Dune Part 2 great. There's some political aspects here, but for me it didn't drag the film down.And the length of Dune 2 is perfect. The pacing of this film is also very good, it never feels like it's dragged out at any point in time, I was always entertained and I think it's a captivating sequal that should not be ignored. It's also a perfect world that projects imagery and some great use of colour and effect. Makes it a great fun film to watch, If you liked the first part, I strongly suggest you watch this one. Because it's even better!Overall Rating:9/10, Would I recommend this film? Absolutely 100% Enjoyed it very much!",positive
297,"As I watched Dune Part Two, I had an increasingly sinking feeling. Oh no. What have they done? Changing things when adapting a book is expected. Different mediums need different approaches. But the changes need to make sense. Things I think are core to Dune are missing from Part Two. New things added don't work as well. I won't list anything here due to spoilers. I'll maybe blog about it in a few weeks. Maybe not. It certainly looks great, and I rated it 6/10 for that. Not for characters and story. You should see it, but be prepared if you know the book. You might get that sinking feeling too. I had a second viewing pre-booked. I didn't go. So disappointing.",positive
298,"An all-time masterpiece. What an incredible movie, a must see for anyone who likes sci-fi, dramatic and action-filled content. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film.It has got it all: thrilling action scenes, romance, politics, mysterious characters and impeccable landscapes.I can not wait for Dune 3 to get out. Can't imagine how can Denis Villenueve improve this movie. Actors performances were out of this world, really liked Chalamet, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh out there. They were giving their all.This is the kind of movies one goes to the cinema for. Disney take note, you might need it for next projects.",neutral
299,"Too much hype hurts even the best movies. There are a bunch of fanboys out there who will fall drooling to the ground when they see a large scale CG battle in a scifi movie. They don't care if there is a plot or character development. Just seeing the pew pews will get them going.This is a good movie and it owes its strength to its incredible predecessor. But in the second installment lost are the sound design, the strong undercurrent of character buildup and the pace that got the viewer in - that made you ""live"" the movie. Villeneuve, having spent 3 hours in Dune:Part 1 building up an entire universe with dazzling believability suddenly rushes through the whole Part 2 to obviously pave the way to a new set of sequels.There is a hectic feeling to the flow of the plot. Villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end. It is a great show-off and you can sense the pride he has in his creation.Character development is lost here. While he allows the young Atreides to mature a little and discover himself, he quickly turns Stilgar into an almost comical, caricaturized fanatic. While trying to enrich the universe with some new players he wastes the good old ones unnecessarily.The visual design is beautiful to behold as ever. May be it is because we have somewhat gotten familiar with them, the impact is less but still there.The sound was one of the strongest aspects of Part 1. Somehow I feel as if it is sacrificed here to make room for more dialogue. And I think it is a great loss.Conclusion to my rant: By any standard this is a good movie. Worthy of a glowing 7 or 7.5 score. However compared to what it could have been, it unfortunately falls short. And it definitely does not deserve a 9.",positive
300,"I enjoyed the movie overall but found myself questioning so much of what was going on. Events were being half told with the watcher being required to assume the rest.As someone who truly enjoys this genre and the original movie, I was really looking forward to this set of movies when it was first announced. After watching the first movie I had fears that it would not live up to the hypeI enjoyed the action sequences and overall production quality of the movies but there always seemed to be something missing. Without giving too much away, there a scene where the main character paul was training to survive in the desert. They gave the impression that he was to learn it and survive a day. Next thing you know zendeya character showing him how its done yet only one scene passes then magically the whole thing is over and the next seen the training has been completed without any results or spoken words about how he did, a congratulation or anything. Expect this type of storytelling to continue through the moviesIn the Part two movie, paul is stabbed in the breast region and then moments later the knife is in his shoulder, not even on the same side of the body. As stated there is no real consistency in this set of films. I almost felt like I was watching another movie based off the same storyI didn't care for timothee as an actor in the first movie. He never at any point gave off a quality of strength or courage. In part two he did better but his character just wasnt all that likeable. Ive never seen timothee in any other films so I am not sure if this is an cast issue or a director issue. Zendeya was also a poor fit. She is a very mediocre actress. Her character was also meant to be a strong character within her people but I got more of an outcast gossip girl. I hsve never seen zendeya in anything else but spiderman and didnt really care for her as the character there eitherI will say that overall as a huge fan of the genre there were moments I truly enjoyed but it was the weak moments about the movie that ruined it for me. Of the space opera genre flicks I found rebel moon which was also a mediocre film, was better than this. Not only were they not as long, but they were paced much better. I rewatch films often but I dont see myself coming back to watch this one ever again.",positive
301,"Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.",positive
302,"For all its stunning visuals and action scenes, Dune: Part 2 is, more than anything else, about people-the grand inter-house politics of the Imperium, the outsiders among the insular Fremen, the believers in prophecy versus the younger self-reliant generation. But at its core, the movie is about motherhood and the lengths to which a mother will go to protect and uplift her child.Littered with lingering landscape shots of Arakkis, the movie pays respect to the planet that gives both the Fremen and the galaxy life, its most valuable resource being spice. But much like a planet raises and nurtures people, giving them the space and protection to grow and learn for themselves while also guiding them with and through challenges-sandstorms and scalding hot days-Paul's mother, Lady Jessica (now Reverend Mother) guides Paul's life, shaping the path she set when she first decided to have a son rather than a daughter.And as much as the power of belief has the potential to corrupt Paul, causing countless deaths across the galaxy, the unconditional love of Jessica for Paul is itself a use of power, a transference of opportunity and protection that confers advantages onto its recipient. Jessica, so confident that her son is the Kwisatz Hadarach, she used the myths that the Bene Gessirit planted in Arrakis to propel Paul into leadership of the Fremen-a substantial feat given that both she and Paul are off-worlders and relatively new to Fremen society. In addition, in both the first and second films, Jessica physically protects Paul while simultaneously training him, using those moments to instruct Paul on how to better himself. Ultimately, it is this belief in her son, training in her ways, and protection as he reaches his potential that allows Paul best Feyd-Rautha and usurp the throne.Spice may be the most valuable substance in the galaxy, but belief is the most powerful source in the Dune universe. But more than a struggling population's belief in a savior, the belief of a parent in their child has truly transformational consequences. In that way, Paul may be the dagger of change, plunged directly into the heart of the Imperium, but Jessica is the knife wielder, living up to her role as a Bene Gessirit, controlling everything from behind the scenes. And it is that same power that she will grant to her unborn daughter when the story continues.",positive
303,"The film was so beautifully done. I could not count how many times I got the chills. Every scene was just so beautiful and powerful.Austin Butler was phenomenal as Feyd-Rautha. I loved every scene when they were at Giedi Prime. They even thought about how the black sun would affect the planet, Giedi Prime. Denis is a genius filmmaker. Then Florence Pugh showed up on the screen, her performance was just how I pictured Princess Irulan would be like. Of course, the magnificent Rebecca Ferguson just took the spotlight everytime she was in a scene. Just her posters alone (as Lady Jessica) outside the cinema would give you chills.Let's not forget Timoth√©e Chalamet and his outstanding performance as Paul Atreides. His speech with the Fremen was one of the many scenes that gave me the chills.I'm really hoping they finish the whole Dune franchise, because with Denis Villeneuve at the helm this would be one of the most popular franchises of all time!",positive
304,"Whether your a fan of the novels, or the 80's version, Dune is truly √† work of art. The scenery was breathtaking and in regards to acting it was clear the actors have embraced and portrayed their characters to √† T in direct correlation to the novel they are portrayed in the most perfect way. I admit I was weary before watching because the first one was just incredible .. but this does not dissapoint, I can only think of 2 other movies in history where the sequel outshined or performed on the same level of the first part and that would either be T2 jugement day,and of course the godfather 2. These titles are renowned and beloved by all, and quite Frankly that's the direction The Dune Saga has broughtforth, your left glued to the scream and asking what? I'm gonna have to wait another 3 years ... what if I don't live that long... Even if you haven't seen the first film, one can pick up and follow along as long as they pay attention to the narrative and direction the film is going in. Because the final showdown does not dissapoint and as I said prior.. Why do I have to wait another 3 years and here I am writing my commentary before healing to work and buying another ticket to see it on the big screen again this evening. Dune delivers in the opposition direction of every failed sequel and just leaves you in awe as the cr√©dits come on screen as your left in disbelief that 3 hours has just passed. Anyways trust me kiddos GO SEE IT IN THEATRES!! You will find yourself in the same situation as me... stuck waiting more.",positive
305,"I still remember where I was when the first Dune movie was announced. Now, after all these years, I'm even more excited for what's to come. Before watching the movie, I read many praising articles and reviews, but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it. Dune Part Two delivers exactly what it promises - a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written. It's a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most pure-hearted leaders to descend into chaos. The film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the Harkonnens and the Fremen's insane harmonization with their planet. The Fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer. The investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on. Denis Villeneuve has done it again and this time, he has hit a home run. Collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation, Greig Fraser, Denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema. It not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself. With its skillful use of practical sets, lighting, and digitized effects, this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker. Although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive, they do not distract from its main focus, which is the storytelling. The film follows a love story that defies all odds, as Paul assumes the role of the Messiah, Chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well. In the first act, Paul's character undergoes significant changes. He tries to distance himself from his mother's actions by joining the Fremen's cause to liberate their planet from tyranny. However, he remains unaware that Jessica's plan is already in progress. Despite this, the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments. The empire is in a state of despair as the Fremen successfully destroy the Harkonnen spice reserves one by one. This has pushed the Bene Gesserit to their limits, and as a result, the Baron has deployed his most valuable weapon, Feyd Rautha. The second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable. And to top it all off, Denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence. In the end, Paul finally realizes what he has to do. He takes the Water of Life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause, but proceeds anyway. By doing so, he loses his one true love, yet he stands his ground in an incredible hand-to-hand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an Emperor. Once again, Hans Zimmer's astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories. I highly recommend watching this film in 70mm IMAX print, if possible.Let's all hope that Dune Messiah will become a reality.",positive
306,"Hands down the best theater experience of my life. I loved Dune Part One so much but Part Two was on another level. Everything was absolutely perfect. I can not find one thing that bothered me whatsoever in this film. You can tell everyone that worked on the film knew they were making something that will be remembered for decades, and it shows.The acting, set pieces, score and costume design are all as good as it can get. There were many moments where the cgi was so good that I honestly couldn't tell if it was practical or not. I just finished reading the first book before seeing this and while there was a lot of stuff left out or changed, I had no issue with it. Even my father who was not a fan of Part One said this is a great film. I hate using the term masterpiece because it is used so much nowadays but Dune Part Two is monumental masterpiece.",positive
307,"Every time the characters open their mouths, it's cringe.The film is a revisionist claptrap of Herbert's original. Gone is the Chani of the book, who both loved Paul for himself and his prophetic and religious nature--this Chani is a socialist revolutionary who only believes in power. Stilgar is a religious lunatic. And Paul--the worst now--is an opportunistic snake who uses his ""prophetic qualities"" to enact a plan of revenge that would make the Count of Monte Cristo crawl back to his prison cell in shame and rethink his life.However, the film is gorgeous. Every scene drips with beauty.Take what you will.Dune on the outside but 2024 political nonsense on the inside. If that bothers you at all, just remember it's streamable now and you have access to the pause button.",positive
308,"It was a packed house for the February 25 fan premiere and the film did not disappoint.Since the first film, several like myself have read the books and now we're going to compare --- because that's what happens when an IP gets famous, i.e. Most of us didn't compare GOT season 1 to ASOIAF when we first watched it.Alia is not in the film. At all, except as a fetus who speaks to Jessica. So of course she doesn't kill the Baron. It actually works out. From a filmmaking point, good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role, even if you age her up.Jessica, in my opinion, becomes the villain after drinking the water of life. She essentially manipulates Paul into become the Mahdi. It was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son, and by extension the Kwizatch Haderach, was due to love or vanity. This would almost now appear to be the latter. Again, just my opinion, but I don't believe the water changed her, more likely it awakened a dormant ambition.Chani is by far the most improved character from the books. With all respect to Frank Herbert, she didn't really do much. She was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the Tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the Dune Saga. She is still all that of course, but while she loves Paul, she's an outspoken cynic concerning him being a Messiah. This was a welcome change.Stilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout. I am mildly disappointed. Nevertheless, he is the most comedic character.Paul kills the Baron. Chani breaks up with him (kinda). The door is wide open for part 3.Those are the most significant changes from the book. I would encourage anyone to watch it and not allow these to detract from your enjoyment.Everyone did a great job on the film as a whole and of course it's a 10!",positive
309,"I'll precursor this by saying 1) I have not read the books 2) I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan 3) I found part one underwhelming.While I find there to be many issues with this film, perhaps its biggest weakness imo is that I hold no emotional connection with any of the characters, despite the film's lengthy runtime. The protagonist's mother is written as incredibly annoying, the villains are underused, Florence Pugh's character has 0 likability and acts simply as a story device. Bardem's character is OK and funny at times and Brolin doesn't have a standout moment. Zendaya's character is the sole exception to this, who is the beating heart of the film.At times, I also felt that Chalamet, despite being an amazing actor, is perhaps miscast, though having not read the material, I cannot comment further on this.The pacing felt off, as it stays too long in places it shouldn't, while sacrificing moments that could linger longer. This coming from a person that enjoys long epics and slow burn films. The movie looks outstanding though feels closer to a connection of rushed story beats. The direction it takes with the main character also does not feel earned.Perhaps the second biggest issue is that I do not totally buy into the world that has been created. It feels large but empty and lacking character. Almost too clean and strange for the sake of it. Style over substance. We stay for most of the time in one or two places which doesn't help. There were also some weird choice of cuts and jumps in scenes that hampered the flow of the film.With that said, there are a couple of epic moments that stood out, which are 1) the whole Zendaya bazooka scene and 2) the giant worm riding.Overall, the film is enjoyable. However without engaging characters, a believable world, and pacing issues, the film falls short of greatness, perhaps way short.",positive
310,"This is without doubt an impressive visual spectacle. However the story line is so thin it's almost transparent. Given the two films add up to almost five hours if you have read the books or seen the TV mini series it won't make much sense in the way the story should be told. There is no rational why Spice is so valuable or how the Bene Gesserit are involved in the whole scheme of thIngs and these are two of the three core tenets of the whole saga. This rendition omits any explanation of the Emperor, Spacing Guild or of Paul's sister Alia.It's sad that the story in these films is so diluted that the spectacles have no attachment.",neutral
311,"I didn't quite fully understand the meaning behind why everyone kept calling Dune Part Two (DPT) ""epic."" I understand now.Having read all the books, thoroughly enjoyed Dune Part One (DPO), and then to watch a back-to-back early release double feature of DPO and DPT I can say I'm beyond impressed. Impressed truly doesnt even begin to embody and sense of the granduity of DPT.DPT seamlessly picks up from where DPO left off, creating an even more immersive experience. Nonetheless, beyond my imaginable capabilities somehow DPT increases the meticulous level of attention and detail to the films mise √©n scene.The costumes once again go above and beyond, I'm not sure how to even put it into words. They looked real. They fit the scenes. They looked like they belong.The musical score, I didn't think it could get better than DPO - I stand a fool! The musical score for DPT leaves you with goosebumps for almost the entirety of the runtime. If it doesn't achieve an award I will truly battle the great houses myself!The visual effects. Lost for words, truly dont think I could encompass how good they are here. You'll have to lead on faith for this one.All the actors and actresses complete this film, not like it's their job, but something they truly want to work on and truly do beyond their capabilities for and this shows.The hype is real. The spice must flow. The third Dune must come.If you liked DPO you will lose it for DPT. Enough said.",positive
312,"Dune: part two is the continuation of the already excellent Dune: part one, and I'm so happy to say that this movie is insane. I really think this movie is amazing in every aspect.Starting with the world building, this was my favorite aspect from the first movie, and this movie builds further on that in such excellence, and in combination with the astounding cinematography I really felt like I was there on arrakis. You will learn much more about the freman and their ways of life which is fascinating. I'm still in shock and I want to go back.All the performance are also so good. The story builds further on all the old characters who are fleshed out even more with new complex layers to them and the new characters who are also all great, especially Austin Butler! His performance makes his character truely scary, such a good villain. Timothee Chalamet is also great is this movie and really shows the complex things Paul is going thru this movie, which was really cool and even scary sometimes to see unfold. The same goes for all the other actors, I just can't say there was a lesser performance, everyone really gave there all and it shows!Also, the score is (again) incredibly good! Hans Zimmer also builds upon the music he made for the first movie, which results in an even better score which also elevates the movie to an even higher level.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, it starts slower, but that's a good thing. It needs that, so in that way everything keeps building upon each other which eventually explodes in one of the best climaxes I have ever seen! I'm really still in awe, and I could keep talking about how great everything is, but believe me, just watch the movie. Go to the biggest screen you can find and watch it. You will be blown away, this is really one of the best films of the generation. Thank you, Dennis Villeneuve and everyone who worked on this movie, and I'll eagerly be waiting for Dune: Messiah!Long live the fighters!100/100.",positive
313,After I read the amazing reviews I kept my expectations low for not being disappointed. It was blow minding. If this movie won't receive an Oscar for best cinematography The Oscar can be cancelled. All actors are amazing but Timothee deserves an Oscar. After seeing him in Wonka and then in this I think he is the most versatile actor at this time. Same thing about Austin. You won't recognise him here. Zendaya interprets one of the most powerful and badass female characters of all time in the most amazing way and she is perfect. Love her. There is no one bad thing I can say about this movie. But I think we need more kind of these movies. Don't miss it for anything in the world and by the way the IMAX really worth it.,positive
314,"Awarding 10/10s, for me, are given only to the likes of Empire Strikes Back, Return of the King, or Raiders of the Lost Ark .... it truly must be great. So to get to the 10 plateau in my critiques reflects a certain quality and value within my little bubble of love for movies. The recent (say last 7 or 8 years) output from the industry has been worse (much worse) than lack-luster, most of the the ""tent pole block busters"" have been cinematic garbage (see for example, The Marvels and as far back as The Last Jedi, basically most anything from Disney but certainly not exclusive to Disney) .Here we have a movie created by a team free of the DEI quotas and agenda driven malarkey and they have produced nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece!!! Probably the best science fiction movie of the decade, ranking it up there with one of the best sequels ever constructed (if you can call it that ... it feels more like the second half of a very long movie). Every aspect of this movie, from the cinematography, to the directing, writing, acting, CGI, sound, score... it is spot on perfect. The amount of talent that went into this movie shows and the end product is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise decaying industry poisoned by toxic one-sided politics, nearly dead and left to rot. I was truly emotional at the end, tears running down my face, not so much moved by the story (which was excellent) but having finally witnessed a truly great movie after years of absolute garbage, the emotion stirred in me was one of relief, a calming repose that great movie making has not been completely killed off and that it is still possible to make a movie that is not promoting ""the message"" or clubbing me over the head with a bunch of nonsense.",positive
315,"I went in with high expectations and they were surpassed. Saw in imax in a new theatre with single laser. Sound design/score and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way I've never experienced. I'm at a bit of a loss for words other than generational, masterpiece, theatrical cinematic experience like nothing I've witnessed before. Loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material. What's so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation. You experience the story from the mind of the character. In the film, the dialogue is there to support the film, which is primary here. The visuals, the cinematography, the sound, the score are all the story, and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that. It's so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the story.Well done. Still riding the high. It will take something truly special to replace this as my new #1.",positive
316,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie yesterday at the Swedish premiere and oh man was a mesmerized by the beauty of it all!Being honest, I instantly fell in love with part one and I have probably watched it more times than what would be deemed sane, or healthy.So, watching part two was a no brainer to me and needless to say, my expectations where very high.As the credits rolled I didn't want to leave my seat. Denis Villeneuve did it again. He blew my mind.He portrayed the world of Dune in a way I didn't believe was possible. Everything is cinematically grandiose and glues you to your seat in awe.The sci-fi elements of Dune are out of this world, not since the release of the first Star Wars have I seen so many innovative solutions to visualise it. Everything from the Harkonnen desert suits to the mortar ships are things never seen before that excites the mind. This paired up with the amazing sound effects offers a cinematic experience like no other.The movie itself, the storytelling, pacing and the acting is stellar. No complaints at all.I might be biased but this is a must for anyone that enjoys sci-fi.11/10 Sandworms.",positive
317,"What's all the hype about? I don't usually write reviews, but this movie is quite overrated. I'm a fan of games, I didn't read the books, but this movie is definitely worse than the first one, which I would rate a maximum of 8/10, which is pretty good. The second part is one movie clich√© after another, not to mention the poor acting. Can we expect the same outcome as Game of Thrones? Well, this one didn't meet my expectations, but they were set pretty high after the first movie and all the buzz about the second one. I would say this is good for streaming services; it could have been an hour shorter (and possibly you wouldn't lose anything from the story).",positive
318,"Dune: Part 2 not only surpasses the first film but elevates it, not many films are able to achieve such feat.Hans Zimmer returns and somehow outdoes himself bringing us a score that rattles you in your seat, memorable epic and somewhat melancholy.Greig Fraser returns, and just like Hans Zimmer he outdoes himself, memorable cinematography that will be imprinted in my head for a long time. The use of color is sublime, the black and white scene is incredible job well done.The performances are all incredible. Zendaya is the true stand out, but Timoth√©e Chalamet is phenomenal, He speaks with such conviction and power This young man is gonna have an incredible career, his acting range is absurd! But the likes of Christopher waltz, Florence Pugh, Javier Bardem are all great! But let's not forget Austin freaking Butler delivering a villainess performance that will be remembered for the ages, menacing, cruel, brutal. The introduction to this character is perfect. You hate him, but you love him.This film doesn't shy away from politics and how it's used is so relevant to todays time, and it also doesn't shy away from the manipulation of politics and manipulation of power and Messiah like figures. It dives deep into religion and It's not afraid to show how it affects the characters.There truly is so much that happens in this film and it's done almost perfectly. I can't think of a flaw. I sat through the whole credits roll and I never do that. I was just speechless with this film. The third act is of the likes of The Two Towers, of the likes of Empire Strikes Back!.None of this would've been achieved without Denis Villeneuve, this man is putting together a resume that stands up to some of the greatest film makers to ever do it! His direction in this film is sublime there's a scene towards the end, where they specifically choose not to use the score and you feel the intensity of the fight on screen and it's powerful.A euphoric experience, a once in a lifetime theatrical experience, A film that isn't afraid to touch on subjects that some would consider taboo, it's simply a masterpiece through and through.",positive
319,"A brilliant cinema experience, every bit as good as Dune Part 1. Incredible visuals and outstanding sound design create an immersive and frighteningly real world. Sci-fi has rarely looked or sounded better.However, in terms of story the movie somehow felt long yet condensed/rushed at the same time. Scenes seemed to move from one to the next because the story needed to move on, not being driven by character or emotion. Some relationships felt underdeveloped, and the story progression at times felt incohesive (like someone accidentally pressed the ""skip to next chapter"" button and you feel like you've missed something).A very good movie - visually and acoustically perfect - but with some story and pacing issues that had it fall short of total perfection, for me.",positive
320,"Omg, where do I even begin. How can you transform a great book with great former adaptations and turn it into a boring AF waste of time.There is no tension, no convincing acting and the pace will make you fall asleep.The casting was made with pleasing the crowds in mind and not with the story, Timothy has the magnetism of plastic and the pairing with Zendaya feels forced and boring.The magical and mystical elements of the book are completely missing or underplayed, as are the political motivations, there is no pending feelings of doom.Also it feels more like a movie set in ancient Arabia rather than in space. In summary save yourself time and money and watch the 1984 version instead.",positive
321,"A love story to the original trilogy.This is how you make a movie out of a book, for all future movie makers out there. While there are divergencies from the books, it thematically follows and still captures the heart of the corruption of power, religion, ecological transformation, ethics, war and violence that Frank Herbert played on in his masterpiece. The multiple shots, sometimes only a few seconds, that paid tribute to conversations and interplay within the books was excellent. I wish they had had time to include the full story given how beautifully choregraphed each scene is, but its already almost 3 hours and somethings just have to be cut.It impressively does all this while still spending enough time on character building and capturing the ""plan within a plan within a plan."" Just well done, I hope there will be an extended trilogy cut in the future. Perhaps someone will even make the sequels/prequels in the future.",positive
322,"From start to end, the world, this movie is bringing to life will leave your eyes wide open throughout the movie. If you're a Sci-Fi lover, there won't be a second you won't be left in awe. Watching the movie was like going through best moments of your own life, when you think that this is the climax there comes another. The Soundtrack will leave you a heart full of emotions when you leave the theatre. It doesn't fail to deliver the universe it promised.Dune-I was just the staircase. After you watch this you will be at the platform where the throne sits. Look forward to watch the next movie from the throne!",positive
323,"I'd suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the Dune universe. From the beginning, you're thrust back into the chaotic, unpredictable, and perilous world of Arrakis. The action is swift and meticulously planned, keeping you engaged from start to finish. What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here. A big thank you to AMC Theatres and WB for the opportunity to experience this in IMAX tonight. I highly recommend a premium format because the immersive sound truly enhances the viewing experience. I'm already looking forward to watching this again. Great flick!",positive
324,Watched it first day and honestly I expected the movie would be great but my god I was wrong this was beyond greatness the movie was literally a masterpiece. I went to the theater expecting the movie to be 9.5 or 10 but this was a 20. I loved everything about this movie and I wish I could watch it again for the first time and you guys those who haven't watched it yet have that privilege do watch it in a theater because this is the best theater experience of the decade. Watch it in 4k Dolby Atmos or atleast watch it in a theater with good sound and audio quality. This movie is a goosebump fest .,positive
325,"I had instants of goosebumps running through my body more times than I can count. It was an absolute thrill to watch. Everything is carefully executed, from the music to the visuals. It is all pure magic and so beautiful to watch. The dynamics of power, beliefs and the environment makes the backdrop for the plot so captivating. The movie was so magical that I completely lost track of time, and thus feared that the movie would suddenly end, because I could not get enough of it. The movie was everything it needed to be and was a perfect adaptation that will probably become one of my all time favorites.",neutral
326,"Never before have I been this excited for the release of a film. When the delay from November to March for Part Two's release happened, it devastated me. But now it is here. I was able to see it almost a week early and it did not disappoint. I am an avid fan of the books, so I will say that most of my criticisms or slight complaints come from wishing to see scenes and characters from the book adapted on to screen, but at the same time, most if not all, of these changes make for a better paced and probably less cluttered final product.The cinematography once again is stunning. The gorgeous sands of Arrakis mixed with the colors of different times of day, the larger than life presence of the sandworms, the dismal and brutal gray of Giedi Prime, the various sietches and places of the Fremen. All of it looks gorgeous. The Hanz Zimmer score returning, capturing perfectly the atmosphere of this desert planet. Loved all of it.The performances of characters evolve, most notably Timothee as he becomes Paul Muadib and Lady Jessica as she takes on role of Reverend Mother. Zendaya as Chani gives much-needed depth to that character from the book, Javier as Stilgar was incredible. Each performance was fantastic. Dave Bautista also shines in his role as Beast Rabban. I could go on and on about each performance, but another well done aspect of this film.If you enjoyed Dune Part One in any capacity and long to see where the story of Paul Atreides and the Harkonnens goes from here, you will definitely enjoy this film as the pacing feels very quick and action packed and the world-building from Part One makes it all pay off here.So many scenes from this Part Two took my breath away and I think Denis did an incredible job adapting the second half of this epic story, despite several changes from the source material. I will definitely see this film again and again, so I can relive this incredible cinematic experience and if you haven't already, definitely give the books a try, and I look forward to the next chapter: DUNE MESSIAH.",positive
327,"There's been a lot of hyperbole and superlatives about this movie since it released. While it is a solid, entertaining sci fi movie, labeling it the GOAT or anything similar to that, is just people fanning out over it. Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing ""special"" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for ""best sci fi film of all time"" to until my last days as a film watcher. This is a solid movie but don't buy into the hype, temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it just fine.Definitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound. The director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen. With that said, the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab. Which, I get it, it's part of the mood and tone the director is going for. But for me it's very sterile and cold. Not an insane fun, hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a ROUSING score that gets you hyped for the action that's unfolding before you. Having seen Dune Part One recently, it's not that I necessarily expected that from this movie but when I heard the ""goat"" word being thrown around, it did raise my expectations of what we'd see on the screen.Again, a fine film but nothing genre defining imo. One of those that you can watch once and you'll be fine with lol.Unlike the best of this genre where you can't wait to rewatch it over and over and over again...! Where the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the characters are rich and layered, and likable figures. The score is fun and captivating even if it's a dark one. You go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie ASAP. In my book, that's the TRUE definition of any films that look to call themselves the greatest sci fi film of all time.",positive
328,"I thought Dune: Part 1 was amazing, but Denis Villeneuve cranked out a masterpiece with Part 2! Every moment was spellbinding, the cinematography epic, the acting authentic, and the world building was astonishing.They made changes form the book, sure, but the changes they made fit in with the tone of the narrative. Zendaya's Chani is strong yet feminine, and you feel both her growth and her struggle throughout the film. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet shines as Paul, he conveys a quiet strength throughout the film, and you believe his struggles as well as his ascent to leadership, he earns it and owns it. The rest of the cast brings their best to the film, every character feels well lived-in.The film is truly visually breathtaking, so many wonderful directing choices. I love that Villeneuve allows us to linger in scenes, to extend the feeling of each world as you visit them. You feel like you have a sense for the Dune universe simply though the visual and sound spaces.Hollywood, this is what we want. Heroic Masculine and Feminine characters, good writing and pacing, authenticity. This is how you do it right, Dune should be a guidebook for the rest of the industry.",positive
329,While I will say it was vibrant and visually captivating and also very well done soundtrack.. however the story was dulled by acting I didn't find believable it was similar to an over budget day time soap.. overall pretty good. I wouldn't say it's an adult film and main characters had more of a high-school teenie bop feel .. hard to believe as an adult those 2 were warriors or leaders .. supporting cast was amazing except Christopher Walken sounded like he stepped out of a newyork deli in the 1940s zero clue how that wasn't supposed to stick out everyone had different accents and his was outrageous ..,positive
330,"Very disappointing if you are a fan of the actual story that Frank Herbert wrote. They deviated way too far from the story, and with the character, Chani, it was so bad that she is nothing like the character in the books. I have know idea what the screen writers and director was thinking.Now Alia, what the heck was that? Alia, a very key character from the books, isn't ever even born by the end. She is a major part of the end of the first trilogy, the stories that this movie was supposed to be based on. Unbelievable!The ending was also changed from that particular book, and left in such a tattered mess I don't see how they could ever do the next story and have it resemble what Frank Herbert wrote. It was just awful in the end.I have to agree with a lot of reviews that mention how the movie was rushed, because it very much was, especially the ending. They probably should have split this up into two movies and took the time to develop the story. I wonder how much the lack of chemistry between the two main characters played into why this movie was rushed. Those two may be decent actors in other things, but they were not good in this, especially the actress that plays Chani, she was awful.At the end of the day the Sci-Fy Channel version is the best, and it is not even close, because they actually liked Dune as Frank Herbert wrote it, and overall stuck to his story. This new version is terrible, David Linch can celebrate in that at least.",positive

332,"Contrasts with Marvel and Star Wars in that it takes itself completely seriously. There is no humor, which allows the intensity to build and lets the world building be immersive. Similar in some ways to Batman movies like The Batman or The Dark Knight.It was a nice experience, I gave it a 10 because asking for more from a movie is unreasonable.Very fast paced, similar to Infinity War, full of action. There isn't much in the way of day to day scenes. At 2:45 hr I don't see any way around that in 1 movie.The Chosen One motif seems well suited to cinema since it allows telling a big story while following one man, but it's definitely disconnected from reality.",neutral
333,"I just saw the new movie ""Dune: Part Two"" and I was speechless.It was amazing, full of creativity and an unforgettable action.From the sensational footage, which I will constantly praise, to the story and everything that the Dune universe means.Shocking scenes, dramatic scenes, romantic scenes but also full scenes, full of action, carnage and explosions.Something I've been waiting for so long and it was more perfect than I expected...In Imax, the sound was so good that at any explosion or need for bass, it creates a shock, an earthquake that gives incredible pleasure.You must see it and I declare that it is the best film of 2024 and I don't think that any of the upcoming movies will be better.

334,"What a movie! One of the best I have ever seen! It was all I wanted and more. The visuals, the sound, the acting, the dialogue - they are all at their highest. Absolutely spectacular!I strongly recommend seeing it in a cinema. The movie is great, but the cinema experience amplifies that grateness.I know the source material was really good to start with, but the way the director captured the storyline, built the characters and delivered it all to the audience, is simply a masterpiece.I think the pace of the movie was perfect. Slow at the times we wanted to savor the moments, fast enough through the rest, and constantly intense.And even though we are introduced to quite a bunch of new characters, they are all given enough time for the audience to understand who they are and what is their role in the story.More of this, please!",positive
335,"Dune 1 and 2 are the greatest works in cinema history, let me explain. Dune is based on Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel, but in this combo, it speaks about politics, the use of religion as a political tool for manipulating the masses, it delves into ecology, and within all that, it intertwines the romance of Paul Atreides and Chani, which challenges politics and the empire. It's a story that demands an extremely complex adaptation for a film that, combining both parts, runs around 340 minutes, but Denis Villeneuve managed to capture the essence of Frank Herbert's literary work and gave us the best sci-fi film in history.",positive
336,"This movie was an absolute masterpiece!The first one was extremely good, and then Denis just blew me away with the sequel. I don't even know how many times I got the goosebumps; it was everything I hoped it would be.The only two things that could have made me rate it a 9 instead of 10, would be:1) the lack of vulnerability from Zendayas character. Would have loved to se her open up a bit more - especially around Paul - instead of almost only the tough impression she has going on.2) The introduction and portraying of Emperor Shaddam could have been a bigger thing - like Baron Harkonnen and the way he is being portrayed.I will gladly pay to watch it a second time in the theater, to be honest.What an experience - LOVED IT - 10/10.",positive
337,"And we're back! Following the......experiment.....that was 2021's Dune, Denis Villanueve is back with the sequel. Like the first one, this is a perfectly crafted piece of sci fi filmmaking, however UNLIKE the first Dune, Dune 2 is not a total snoozer as things actually happen on screen this time around. The shots, the music, the sound design are all top notch.I still find myself baffled by these movies. Again, I am the super ultimate target audience for weird sci fi stuff, and I love most of Denis Villanueve's work, even with all of the whiz bang taking place in Dune2, I still found myself yawning at times. I can't keep track of any of the characters names, I have only a basic understanding of who is doing what, I am not mesmerised by Timothee Chalamet nor Zendaya's acting. They both seem kind of wooden to me. Also, by about the 17th or 18th time they push in for a super close up on Zendaya's weird face and linger there for what seemed like hours on end, I began to grow weary.I don't know, I think I must be the problem. Everyone else in the world seems to love these same movies, so I must be some sort of freak or miscreant.To me this is an amped up version of the first Dune. More battles and action, more sand, more death, it's just more.",positive
338,"Appreciate that everyone is entitled to their opinion, so here's mine: anyone giving this less than a solid 9 needs to re-evaluate themselves as a person. Because you either have no imagination or are just generally a negative human. This film has everything and is a modern day great. Easily the best cinematic experience I've ever had, comparable to films like the dark knight trilogy and the original Star Wars films.For a nearly three hour long film, basically nobody got up to go for a toilet break and the entire time I felt totally present, gripped by it.Don't listen to anyone on here leaving poor reviews. Go and watch the film and see the magic for yourself.",positive
339,"I liked the overall pacing of things much better in the first part. I can compare pretty well because I watched the first part night before the second part. First half is filled with dialogue, then second half is very rushed. Ironically, I think this movie works much better on small screen than on IMAX, where I saw this. Just because there is so much dialogue and actually not that much of visually impressive scenes which would work better on IMAX.Feels like they used the time in less important places. Sardukan are suddenly poor cannon fodder instead of empires finest fighters. Paul and his savvy mates taking suddenly harvesters with gadgets they just suddenly happen to have. Nothing is explained via moving pictures. Not anything like how they organize the strikes against Harkonen or how they happen to have weapons of different variety and so on. Things just happen. Suddenly just because it's conventional Paul walks to different places without virtually any kind of resistance or drama just so that he can convey some lines which should be meaningful for the viewer. As it was in the first part, they don't really show the view of Harkonens. I liked the dynamic between the Harkonen baron and Rabban in the first movie, even though that they did gave very little of time for that side of the story in the first part, but they give even less time in this movie.I expected at least something to really stand out in a production of this scale but nothing really stands out. Not writing, not actor performances, not music, nothing. The movie is kind of nice to see how things developed from the first part but that's pretty much it. That's why for me this movie is 6/10.",negative
340,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills or have missed a dose, as I cannot comprehend the high praise for this sequel.I adored Part 1, which introduced me to this trippy Sci-Fi and the grandeur of a far-flung potential future.Part 2 was all spectacle, yelling, and repetition (we get it, he's the chosen one), marred by:poor editing (I'm genuinely shocked they didn't start the film on Giedi Prime with that battle sequence. Beginning it there would have pulled us in to this weird SciFi world and made it clear that there was some horrific villain who would be a huge threat to Paul and his ambitions, instead we got a slow paced intro about returning a dead body. Dull)Lackluster pacing (yes, there's a lot to cover, but the narrative swings between too much happening and sudden lulls, or a weird build-up to a climax that kind of just happens out of nowhere - bang - and it's done).The lead, Timothee, falls short of charisma (he's genuinely trying, but he seems miscast)The romance feels totally unconvincing (almost as bad as that romance in Attack of the Clones).The villain, despite a cool appearance, lacks depth. Yes, he's psychotic and needs to constantly look up beneath a furrowed hairless brow to show us that, but he's not scary or threatening.Maybe I need to watch it again, but I was disappointed for sure, and I don't really know if it's just me missing something or if everyone's expectations of good films are being watered down, and we're forgetting that good movies get under your skin, whereas this one barely made a scratch.",positive

342,"This film really satisfied me after the somewhat boring treat in the previous film, this film was like an outlet. Very elegant and clever moves to avenge what happened in the previous film, I liked the character development of the antagonist but all the actors and actresses played their roles very well, the music composed by Hans is beyond doubt. Don't forget, I want the highest appreciation to the party responsible for the CGI. It's been a long time since I've seen a film with subtle CGI like this. However, perhaps the thing that needs to be improved is that the one by one scenes are not shown intensely and optimally This film deserves appreciation from the audience, not just professional critics. Good work for Denis and everyone, extraordinary.",positive
343,"Best cinematic experience of my life so far, absolutely astonishing. LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack leaves a lasting impression that sticks with you long after you leave your seat. The performance from each member of the cast were uniquely mesmerizing and powerful. The sheer scale of this film surpasses anything I've ever witnessed and is a testament to the quality and craftsmanship of Denis Villeneuve. The stark contrast of Paul from the first to last act is astonishing. I can't quite yet get to grips with how this film has affected me. This will go down as a core memory for me seeing this in cinema and not waiting for it to be available on a streaming platform. Cinema is alive and thank you all for this amazing experience.",positive
344,"I had pretty sky high expectation with this film and this film somehow exceeded them greatly. This is an epic grand story that needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. From the visuals to the sound design, acting, story, this is truly the lord of the rings of this generation. This film focuses on the second half of the book which has all of the big war scenes and this film is honestly adapted a little more loosely from the book compared to the first part which I thought was brilliantly adapted. Zendaya really steals the show with her performance along with everybody else in this film. Even if you didn't like the first dune, trust me, you'll fall in love with this one.",positive
345,"Caught the sneak preview last night of Dune 2. How do you put in words the magnificence of a film? There's been many through time but this one just set the bar I believe. First off you've got to see it on IMax. I don't know if the smaller screen would have the same feeling. The effects are seamless. There's nothing else to say about that. And the story is complete from start to finish. But the thing that really sets it apart is the music and sound design holding hands with the effects and cinematography. It's powerful. There were moments when I found myself mesmerized by the effects and sound and lost track of the story a bit, but the phenomenal performances by Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler brought me right back and were quite impressive. Zendaya was equally amazing. I don't want to give much away, but there are some beautiful nods to the very first dune that David Lynch directed and I think it's actually better than the first Dune '21 Denis Villeneuve did. He is simply a genious.",positive
346,"Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a contemporary cinematic masterpiece, echoing the epic scale and impact of the Lord of the Rings trilogy for our generation. Denis Villeneuve's directorial prowess shines through in every frame, orchestrating a visual spectacle that transcends its predecessor. The expansive landscapes of Arrakis, meticulously crafted through a blend of practical effects and CGI, draw audiences into a mesmerizing and authentic world.The ensemble cast, led by the compelling Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet reprising his role as Paul Atreides, delivers performances that breathe life into the rich characters populating Frank Herbert's universe. Although it's very clear that this movie is Timoth‚àö¬©e and Zendayas show.Hans Zimmer's musical composition elevates the film to new heights. His score, a symphony of haunting melodies and tribal beats, seamlessly integrates with the narrative, intensifying the emotional resonance of pivotal moments. Zimmer's contribution becomes an integral part of the Dune experience, leaving a lasting impression.In exceeding expectations, ""Dune: Part Two"" solidifies its place as a cinematic tour de force. It sets a new standard for the sci-fi genre, offering a timeless and unforgettable experience. Denis Villeneuve's vision, coupled with impeccable visuals, a stellar cast, and a haunting musical score, ensures that ""Dune: Part Two"" will be celebrated as a monumental achievement in filmmaking, leaving an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape of our era.",neutral
347,"This is a truly amazing movie that showcases Villeneuve's artistry on multiple levels. Many storytelling choices that deviate from the book were actually smart, so a lot of thought definitely went into the script. But somehow the big picture got lost.What I found very evocative in the first Dune film by Villeneuve was Paul's struggle with his mother's vision for his life. It formed a kind of emotional core in the movie which suited the format perfectly. When you spend 2-3 hours in the cinema, you expect a certain story arc.This theme is obviously also a major red thread in the books and so continues in Part Two. But all the spectacular imagery, music and ethos does not make up for the rather wooden character development of Paul. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chamalet is a fantastic actor so you follow the story anyway. The film would have been so much stronger though if his evolution from troubled teen to messianic warlord were just a little more carefully crafted in the script.This shortcoming is also visible in Paul's relationship with Chani. On many levels their romance is very plausible and compelling. Towards the end of the film, the mystery wrapped around Paul's destiny inevitably comes between them. But there is so much storytelling potential in this emotional timebomb that just seems to fall flat.Besides these and other minor flaws, there are so many reasons to see this film. Some of my favorite moments are delivered by the actors Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica), Zendaya (Chani), Stellan Sk‚àö‚Ä¢rsgard (Baron Harkonnen) and the chilling Austin Butler (Feyd-Rautha).",positive
348,"Excellent 10/10 movie - Denis brought the fun back to film, Timothy & Zendaya did amazing jobs. Austin did very well too, would have loved to have seen more of him. I now just can't wait for Dune 3!!! The trailers don't do this film justice, and I love that there is consistent action... you will be amazed by both the start of the film and the ending... You really do need a big imax experience with a huge screen to enjoy, as the cinema I was in was abit loud... best to say I will 100% be watching this again and a massive well done the whole entire cast, after my disappointment with films over the past few years.. this has breathed life back into it. Great job all!",positive
349,"I was super hyped to watch the movie, there are very few if any films with this high a rating. I don't get it. Why is this bit now in black and white. I really struggled to watch it . Literally nothing happens. There's a gladiator remade scene which was odd. It's a bit of a mish mash of stuff while slick and fantastically well made, it's a bit boring. I don't care about the characters. The guy from guardians of the galaxy basically plays the same comic role which I don't know if this wasn't intentional humour but the best bit in a very serious movie.Christopher Walken looks like he's going to say where am I any moment, sort of looks a bit lost.Overall stunning visuals, truly epic, but for 3 hours very little happens and the mix of styles is a bit confusing. The characters are a bit sterile and the story takes too long to unfold.",positive
350,"Going fresh from finishing Dune part two, I'll let this be a continuation of my review of part one.It's visually a very amusing movie, starts of fresh, with at least some amount of story.The expectations are high (compared to 2/10 I gave part one). And they keep being high, for like 3/4 of the movie.And at that point you start giving up. You realize there's no big reveal coming. Nothing unexpected, or at least resembling a story that evolves.When I've been so critical in part one, mainly because of the huge cliffhanger it ends on, my friend said: ""just you wait for part two""Well I did, and I still can't see the appeal.0/5 for a movie that tried, but was over hyped, and a proof that you can't turn a bad book into a good movie.",positive
351,"Better than anything Marvel, Star Wars or DC has put out since the 90s. Avengers feels like Peppa Pig compared to this, honestly hahahaAs good as a Dark Knight but even more epic.In a league of its own.It was best movie experience of my life. The film builds perfectly, leaves you pumped and heartbroken at the same time. I had no problems with Walken as Emperor. In a universe where every character is either intense, crazy or over the top, I liked that the Emperor is calm and discreet. The whole cast is great, shout out to Javier Bardem being a perfect comic relief. Chalamet is impressive, Zendaya, Rebeca, Austin, everybody did a great job.Hans Zimmer shines again and Denis Villeneuve is already one of the great filmmakers of this century. It will not surprise me if in time he is considered one of the best to ever do it.",positive
352,"Quite literally a one of a kind movie, I came in expecting greatness and it still exceeded any and all of my preconceptions.How Villeneuve manages to keep story, setting, sound and soul consistent throughout this otherworldly space opera is beyond me and I am simply happy we finally get to share in its greatness. Apart from the fact that towards the ending some of the scenes feelt a bit rushed (death of Rabban, the arrival and defeat of the emperor), there were no cracks in the impenetrable armour of Dune. I could keep going for 10000 words but simply believe me when I tell you you need to see this film.",positive

354,"Dune: Part Two is a kind of movie that makes some of you people think ''Umm..Another 2H 46M long movie, might feel boring, But after you finished watching it you just wish that it was longer than that.Yes, I wanted more.Denis Villeneuve crafted his DUNE world so Beautifully that you can't resist going back. You started watching it and you instantly feel yourself locked up with the screen. The level of Detail in every frame is crazy, stunning. From the religious Fremens to Brutal Harkonnens every single tribe has their own recognition. You can differ them by their gorgeous costumes, their culture, their own living spaces. Dune 1 & 2 is justice to Frank Herberts novel. And all of that was possible because Denis Was selected as the Director. He lead the crew and handled every sector very professionally that the outcome is unbelievably epic.Thanks to

Dune: Part Two is one of the greatest movies that I've ever seen in my life as well as one of the best movie theater experiences of my life.Everything about the filmmaking in this movie was absolutely perfect. The acting, writing, directing, special effects, cinematography & musical score wre executed to perfection from start to finish. Denis Villeneuve has once again proven why he is one of the best filmmakers in the business today.Inconclusion, Dune: Part Two is the best movie that I've seen in 2024 so far & I don't see any other movie dethroning it from my #1 spot. GO OUT, WATCH IT & BUY IT!!!!!",positive
356,"I would say that my expectations going into the movie were somewhat high. The book is highly loved and I enjoyed the first movie greatly. And yet, it blew my mind. One of my first thoughts coming out of the theater was how it compared to empire strikes back. I mean could this have been better? Maybe. It certainly gave me more goosebumps. It was more visually stunning and had a soundtrack that while not as iconic, certainly feels more true to the atmosphere of the movie. It had been a long time since a sci-fi made me forget I was watching a movie. The movie has three strengths: the beginning, the middle, and the end. Although the beginning and end were definitely my favorite. Now I'm just crying thinking about waiting for part three.",positive
357,"I was really looking forward to this and while it was good, I wasn't blown away. I question some of the casting (Christopher Walken really?) and the sense of timing / pace seemed off. A lot was not explained well and I felt it skipped around too much and spent too much time on atmospheric moments when a bit more story building was called for. Even the iconic moment of riding the sandworm seemed a bit rush and then when the moment arrived it was a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, visually appealing and great technical work. But the story which was written by a grand master of Science Fiction was given short shift. Hard to believe that in an almost 3 hour movie a lot of what made Dune great was given rudimentary mention or skipped all together. Whats with the hype ""Anna Taylor Joy"" she had a what 15 second clip. A lot of skilled actors barely had any screen time or fulfilling character arcs. More good have been done. I liked it but I've read the books multiple times. Someone with no history of the books would likely be confused. Let's hope the story takes a more prominent place in part 3.",positive
358,"I just experienced an early access showing, and I have to say, it was mind-blowing. Seriously, do yourself a favor and catch it in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world-building, storytelling, score, action sequences, cinematography - you name it, it's all top-notch. Denis Villeneuve really outdid himself; it's like a masterclass in filmmaking. The casting choices were spot-on from start to finish, and the new additions just elevated everything. Timothee Chalamet nailed it as Paul Atreides - so believable, raw, and real. He owned that lead role. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin were all fantastic as usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continued to bring the evil vibes. Austin Butler stole the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken added a solid freshness to the cast.In a nutshell, Dune: Part Two is an awe-inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi masterpiece that seamlessly blends myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a rare gem of filmmaking, something you don't see often in today's cinema landscape.",positive
359,"The visual and auditory spectacle is brilliant. But dune is about the journey of self realization. The central core of Dune is around the sleeper must awaken dialogue which is not captured in both parts. Only David Lynch's movie captures that essence.I would urge everyone to watch David Lynch version before this.Also, some scenes are very anticlimatic. Certain characters have been downpoured into something they are not as seen in part one. Some scenes have been elongated way too much and some scenes requiring more context have been cut short.Dune book series is an epic. An epic needs nurturing of all characters. Even if the movie is nurturing only the central character, the essence of the character is missing.",neutral
360,"This is one of those films that is overrated by a whole 5 stars because people who don't get it or fall asleep blame themselves rather than the film. Their inclination is to follow the herd... or the emperor in this case. Only problem is that the emperor has no clothes. It's a cultural phenomena whereby if something seems or has the pretence of being intelligent, half the population is scared to call it out as dumb.It's just a bunch of nonsense art-house type scenes thrown together without any particular order or purpose.. and they could do some decent CGI because, thanks to the abundance of sand, there is really very little on screen at any one time.There's really nothing else here and nothing that works.",neutral

Denis pulls off the spectacle and the story in such a marriage of wonder that it would be wise that no attempt is ever made again to make this book into a movie... this IS the book. Every character is solid, totally sold on every actor's portrayal of their character.

367,"By Ian Chandler - March 11, 2024Dune: Part Two is a largely remarkable sci-fi spectacle that benefits greatly from the buildup of its fantastic predecessor. Continuing almost directly after the first part, the film reinvites viewers to the atmospheric, entrancing world of Arrakis in the shoes of Paul, now accompanied with the Fremen. Also complementing the film is the score. This soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, enhances the film's overall mood; even so, it is not a particularly memorable one. The cinematography is one of the picture's greatest highlights, providing stunning visuals that are certainly going to be on display for those 8K televisions on sale. The first act is mysterious and tense. The set pieces and plot points are both otherworldly and eerie. It glues one's eyes to the screen, and refuses to let them go.Character development is a large focus throughout the film and the world of Arrakis is further explored. Timothee Chalamet is talented in the lead role, giving in convincing emotion without going overboard. Zendaya plays the role of Chani, though her portrayal here is similar to another character she played, Michelle Watson. Several other A-list actors light the screen as well. Austin Butler in particular does a phenomenal job as an incredibly frightening villain. Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd's talent as the Baron also returns, with the same sinister energy found in the preceding film. The remaining actors do a well job at their roles, but are lacking in screen time to give too much of an impression.With the above-average acting, the appropriate score, and the exceptional cinematography, the first two hours are excellent! The last thirty minutes, unfortunately, are a weak point. The pacing is thrice in speed and unspecified aspects feel lazier than they should. This was also a problem in its 1965 source material, and it is a shame to see no improvement in the movie released nearly sixty years after. It is no dealbreaker; even so, it does hamper the film's overall quality by no small margin.Dune: Part Two - 74/100
The film is ambitious, atmospheric, and well-acted, but its third act goes at the speed of a bullet train.",positive

The creativity is OFF THE CHARTS. The directing is brilliant and I don't use that word lightly.But the characters aren't having any fun, and they aren't fun to watch. All of my favorite sci-fi movies have likable characters. Star Wars had Han and Luke and Leigh with a side of Chewy. Terminator 2 had Arnold, and Linda Hamilton. Alien had Sigourney.

This was always, at least for me, one of the sci-fi masterpieces with a storyline that was almost sacred.Part 1 was sublime in terms of character development, pace and adherence to the storyline. Compared with this, Part 2 a dismal failure of discrete battle scenes, one dimensional characters and a serious deviation from the storyline. In my view, they tried to stretch the success of the first movie into a third installment for commercial reasons and in the process butchered Part 2. I will not
waste time on any follow-up installments.",neutral
371,"First and foremost the movie is a masterpiece. The vast majority of the poor reviews come from hardcore book fans (disclaimer: I'm one) complaining about variations from the book. I won't elaborate on details to avoid spoilers but what needs to be understood is that it is a different media. Decisions were made by Villeneuve to suppress elements that are present on the book to allow a better flow of the story without compromising its main plotline. He has succeeded in my opinion. Including all the components of the book would inevitably lead to underdeveloped storylines. Another reason for one of his most criticized decisions is obviously technical. Yes, I'm talking about a certain key book character that ""appears"" in a different way in the movie. This character would have to be done in CGI or with an actor dubbing another. I believe both outcomes would be subpar in comparison with how it was handled.For those who have not seen the movie (having read the books or not): go! Make sure you select the biggest available screen (I went for IMAX) and buckle up for the ride. Enjoy your trip to Arrakis.",negative

They played it straight the whole time, dramatic, epic, no quips, amazing special effects that never felt excessive. A true blockbuster of a type I hadn't seen in ages.I hope this is the start of a new trend. I'm going to see it again, even though I almost never see movies twice in the theaters this is worth it. See it in IMAX if you can.",positive

374,"Hear me out: I love sci-fi, and Denis Villeneuve is very skilled at creating Dune Pt. 1, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival. Now we have Dune Pt. 2, which I just saw in IMAX at an early screening last night. It is, as you might expect, a technical marvel with a stacked cast who all bring their A-game. Like The Two Towers or Empire Strikes Back, it expands on the lore, worldbuilding, develops the main characters and introduces new ones. Most of what was set up on the story and character front is paid off to some degree here. The battle sequences are incredible and creative in places. I think it's safe to say that if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one. BUT, it's easier to admire than to love, with the characters at arms' length, even by the time the credits rolled. Keep in mind that while the movie is very good, it still has pacing issues and is too long. In fact, there is so much going on here that it feels like two movies' worth. This is not as great as the hype makes you believe (masterpiece, next LOTR, etc.). But as a sequel to Dune, it works well enough to entertain while suffering from that middle-chapter syndrome that most second chapters do.",positive

Zimmer's ability to craft soundscapes that evoke feelings and enhance the narrative is unparalleled, and in ""Dune: Part 2,"" he once again showcases his talent with top-notch compositions that resonate throughout the entire movie.The cast delivers standout performances, with each actor bringing their character to life in a way that feels authentic and captivating. From the stoic Paul Atreides portrayed by Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet to the fierce Lady Jessica played by Rebecca Ferguson, the ensemble cast shines in their respective roles.One cannot overlook the breathtaking cinematography that transports viewers to the vast and mystical world of Arrakis. Every shot is a work of art, capturing the sweeping landscapes and intricate details of the Dune universe.Watching ""Dune: Part 2"" is more than just a movie-watching experience; it's a journey. The feelings evoked during the film, the sense of wonder and awe, linger long after the credits roll. It's akin to going on a retreat to an island of pure relaxation, where every moment is filled with a sense of freedom and immersion in a world unlike any other.As the credits rolled, the anticipation for the third installment is palpable. The wait may be painful, but the promise of ""Dune: The Prophecy"" as a TV series is something to look forward to. With the bar set so high by ""Dune: Part 2,"" one can only imagine the heights that Villeneuve and his team will reach in the next chapter of this epic saga.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise it receives. It's a testament to the true art of cinema and a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the magic of storytelling on the silver screen.Rating: 5/5 stars.",positive
377,"Like the prequel, this movie is a technical masterpiece. Stunning cinematography, and the soundscape is extremely well composed.But, what is has in spades on the technical front, it severely lacks on other fronts. Unlike the prequel, this movie takes several departures from the book, most of which I'm not entirely sure why, and some seems downright uncharacteristic. As an example, Chani's disbelief in the prophecy. I get that the persuasion of the Fremen is a key in the story, and this is a way to highlight it further, but her being in love with Paul, and then not believing in him or supporting him at all, at times directly disrespecting him, seems very irrational.In general, the characters felt shallow and I had no engagement in them whatsoever. I don't think Timothee Chalamet was well cast as Paul. Acting was overall decent, but there somehow was something missing in terms of character depth and development. I think it comes down to the pacing of the movie. Example when Paul needs to learn to ride the worms, one scene is Stilgar telling him it requires a lot to master, next scene is literally Paul riding the biggest worm they have ever seen.The storytelling also completely fails to convey the complexity of the political system, the role of spice, and how each player tries to take advantage.In the end, a grand attempt at translating a classic book, that ultimately falls short on character depth/development and overall storytelling. That said, still very much above your average Hollywood action flick.6/10.",positive
378,"I was blessed to watch the early fan premier of the movie and was left nearly speechless. Every scene is crafted with care and love from the director, crew and actors. The story choices made by Villeneuve work to perfection. Every actor took a step up in their performances from Dune 1. The only reaction i could muster walking out of the theater was that Dune 1 now feels like a movie that was held back and filtered because Dune 2 is everything to 110 percent. But above all, the movie-viewing experience in a big theater is on par with the most epic and satisfying films of all time. Even if a viewer doesn't care about the story, this movie is a true spectacle on the big screen.",positive
379,"Dune: Part 2 is a remarkable technical achievement that blends the line between arthouse cinema and a commercial blockbuster and continues to raise the standard for sci-fi epic cinema.Director Denis Villeneuve ups the spectacle factor, delivering large-scale desert action sequences against a romping Hans Zimmer score. Greg Frasier's breathtaking cinematography continues to reach new heights.It takes tremendous artistry and effort to find depth and shadow in a perpetually flat and bland desert. I tried to photograph a desert on holiday recently. It's bloody difficult.The spice, presented as fine sparkling orange grain sprinkled in sand, is sumptuous and addictive to look at. The sandworm riding sequence in IMAX is spectacular. PeriodAs Paul Atriedes, Timothy Chalamet convincingly transitions from a boy into a full-fledged leader with a hard edge and grit. The central theme of being a messiah for the support of the masses for personal gain without true faith in the cause is richly fascinating.And yet, Dune: Part Two is a less engaging experience.Part Two uses the pacing of a commercial blockbuster to cover a bigger chunk of its ambitious story. Having rewatched the first Dune an hour before seeing the second, the pacing was jarring.What's gone is the lingering mood from the first Dune, where the shots were held a bit too long and slowly immersed the audience into its world. There was a metaphysical quality to Paul's contradictory visions that was compelling. The mood was delivering all the emotions.Now, these wistful moments are shortened and traded for plot points. It is delivered like summarized information.I'm aware I'm in the minority and the stylistic transition worked for most people, which is great. I just left the theater exhausted-undesirably I might add.Perhaps it's the nature of the source material itself. Frank Herbert's book is embedded with lots of scattered themes. The challenge of adapting it theatrically will always be choosing parts of it and condensing it into something cohesive.The first Dune captured my imagination more deeply. It was like slowly walking into a world with culture, history and intimate access into the characters' inner thoughts. Part Two retained some of those qualities, no doubt, but now's there's an usher hurrying me along to keep the line moving.",positive
380,"The first one when I saw it I felt it was terrible editing, so much runtime and still Lynch's version showed things better, clearer, made more sense. This movie is inaccessible, and it wants you to think that means it is good. It wants you to think that makes it an immersive world without exposition scenes but instead it becomes hard to care about. Things happen whether you are following or not, everything is gorgeous and the music is epic but you step back and wonder why characters do things. The story has been cast aside and the actors are trying so hard to be equally engrossing with very little to work with. The leads have no chemistry, they expect the audience to read the book before seeing it. So because of that it fails as a movie. It works well as inspiration to read the books though.",positive
381,"The film picks up seamlessly from where the first part left off, with Paul Atreides embracing his destiny as the messianic figure known as Muad'Dib. As Paul navigates Arrakis, he faces new challenges and discovers himself together with the enigmatic Fremen warrior Chani, whose relationship with Paul deepens amidst the turmoil of revolution.Visually stunning and meticulously crafted, transporrted me to the desolate yet enchanting world of Arrakis,The cinematography captures the grandeur of the desert planet while also highlighting its harsh beauty.In addition to its visual and narrative prowess, ""Dune: Part Two"" also explores themes of power, religion, and identity with thought-provoking depth. As Paul grapples with his newfound status as a religious figurehead and the weight of his own destiny, the movie raised compelling questions about the nature of leadership and the consequences of such power.Overall, this was a masterful continuation of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation, delivering spectacle, substance, and emotional resonance in equal measure. With stunning visuals, compelling performances, and rich thematic depth, it was and always will be, a must watch for me.",neutral
382,"This is a return to big cinema that passionately screams the heightened possibilities of big-scale filmmaking. Dune: Part Two is a masterful film in its ability to capture the imagination. While sci-fi, the only ""aliens"" you will encounter are the inhumane humans you are forced to accept as humans. An all-time character study of the human race and its faults. There is a power here that tasks the audience with quiet-car-ride introspective questions.How does religious fanaticism corrupt mankind, and how is this human condition controlled?What does ""revenge"" mean, and how far should one pursue it? To what end?When do hopeful beliefs turn into blind faith? And does this inspire goodness, evil, or something else entirely?With this film, Denis Villeneuve easily places him into the coveted conversation of the greatest sci-fi directors of all time. Here, he crafts a world that oozes mythology and philosophy, sprinkled with excellent action set-pieces.Extremely timely, but timeless in its commentary of who man is. Not only a visual feast to enjoy, but something that will leave you challenged: something rarely experienced nowadays.",positive
383,"Despite its long run-time, I was on the edge of my seat for most of this film. The action, the drama, the character development, even the romance! It was all incredible. See it on the largest screen possible to maximize the viewing experience. Timothee Chalamet was perfect as Paul. It's hard to believe the sweet boy from the first Dune was able to transform into the Muad Dib, but he did completely. Zendaya was fierce as Chani and Austin Butler chewed the scenery as Feyd-Rautha. I can't wait to see it again, and I eagerly await new of the filming of Messiah. But I first I guess I better read it!",neutral
384,"Last 20 Mins is just pure goosebumps √∞≈∏‚Äù¬•√∞≈∏‚Äù¬•
Denis Villeneuve proves that he is a next genius mind director after James Cameron.Totally speechless no words to say there's a lot of stories going around in the film but the way director has managed the characters and the timings that they are in specially the political situation and then there's the magic realm all at once is not an easy job but Denis Villeneuve has done it and the film is remarkable.Dune 1 ending has made a lot of suspecious about the half ending of the film specially it was also criticised by the people by not the proper ending but DUNE 2 will make everyone quiet. Because the ending of the film is perfectly well balanced and it's gives a hope of the next and the last one to come.Story, screenplay, cinematography and other aspects top of the world specially the CGI of Dune franchise is something else to witness that I've never witness before. Totally different from other films.Costumes & Visual presentation is outstanding no complaints there at all.Performance are the also one of the big surprise of the film specially TIMOTHEE CHALAMET, ZENDAYA, REBECCA FERGUSON & AUSTIN BUTLER a phenomenal performance by all of them with rest of the cast doesn't disappoint too.Dune 2 will definitely give an experience that you haven't witness specially in battle scenes the tensions that director build is just brilliant. There should be more battle scenes or those were there in the film weren't as long as the 1st part but still it's justifies the film because the story has so much to tell as you'll easily get invested into that.Overall A Complete Visual Masterpiece just like the 1st one but with more story perfection and complexities you're gonna witness in this one.A worth watch and give a IMAX experience because the visuals will just store your interest very well. A Highly Recommended...",positive
385,"Dune 2 is perfect as the sequel. It is equally engaging, stylish, serene and deliverer of exqusiteness in narratives. A twisting climax and well made plot, perhaps will go for part 3, only will then make sense of the entire story from part 1. Waiting for part 3 which I feel will be optimistic in whole. But don't miss its prequel, it's a recommendation.The acting is good, with all performers giving their best that creates unique characterization in sci-fi set up. The technicals are top notch, Hans Zimmer especially. His work in sci-fi is unquestionably perfect,
just above the world. Dennis Villeneuve too is one of the best upcoming director of Science Fiction genre. His works appeals to what sci-fi really stands for, the narratives and presentations are always appealing. An expected liberator from injustices in the exoplanet having sand as the elixir of life mixing with political issues, true love and and the bit- pieces of religious propaganda forms the storyline. The climax is not expected though but will make you think about the film. The special effects, the CGI, the action scenes are all amazing to watch. The introduction of the new antagony is good though, a kinda fearsome and truly evil.Dennis Villeneuve's Dune is a franchise from Sci-fi genre that would rank similar to The Dark knight franchise in action genre and Lord of rings franchise from Fantasy genre. Summing up it's a brilliant film with stunning visuals, good storyline and impressive actions plus narrations. The book lovers must give it a definite watch. A 10/10.",positive
386,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune: Part Two"" arrives, fulfilling the promise of its predecessor with stunning visuals, epic action sequences, and a deeper dive into Frank Herbert's captivating universe.The film is a feast for the eyes. From the vast, shimmering deserts of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, every frame is meticulously crafted and awe-inspiring. Building on the foundation laid in Part One, the action is bigger, bolder, and more thrilling. The sandworm battles are particularly impressive, showcasing the immense power and scale of these creatures. While the first half focuses heavily on world-building, the sequel delves deeper into character development. We see Paul Atreides (Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet) grapple with his destiny, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) navigate the Fremen power dynamics, and Chani (Zendaya) emerge as a strong voice of reason. The cast delivers strong performances across the board. Chalamet continues to impress as the conflicted Paul, while Ferguson brings depth and complexity to Lady Jessica. Zendaya shines with her nuanced portrayal of Chani, and the supporting cast, including Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, adds further weight to the narrative.The film's first half feels rushed at times, cramming in a lot of exposition to catch viewers up on plot points left unresolved in Part One. This can be jarring for those unfamiliar with the source material. While visually stunning, the film struggles to match the emotional weight of the first installment. The complex themes of power, destiny, and ecological balance are present, but not fully explored. The film ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for a potential third part. While this may leave some viewers satisfied, others might find it frustrating.The cinematography by Greig Fraser is magnificent, capturing the vastness of Arrakis and the intricate details of the Fremen culture. The score by Hans Zimmer is once again powerful and evocative, adding to the film's epic atmosphere. The sound design is immersive, placing viewers right in the heart of the action.""Dune: Part Two"" is a visually stunning and action-packed continuation of the epic saga. While the pacing and emotional impact are not quite as strong as the first film, the performances, technical aspects, and deeper exploration of the characters and world make it a worthwhile experience for fans of science fiction and grand-scale storytelling. However, be prepared for a conclusion that leaves you wanting more.",neutral
387,"This movie had some of the most impressive visual effects of any I have ever seen. Seeing it in IMAX was an experience. That said, I didn't love the story or the pacing.I did not feel like the movie dragged on (despite being almost 3 hours) but it was extremely choppy and important moments/character arcs were not well developed. With 3 hours of runtime, I would have liked to see more development and explanation!A few examples of this:
1) the scene were Paul needs to navigate the desert alone. This was supposed to be a major canonical event to show that he is the messiah. He goes out alone, is immediately met by Zendaya, and then the scene ends with no further discussion. The worm riding was similarly undeveloped (no training scenes, etc)
2) The transformation of both Paul and his mother. They seem to both immediately jump into their new personas 100% as soon as they drink the water. I think it would have been more interesting to show them grow into their new roles, or at least show some introspection about how abrupt the changes were.A few other things I didn't love: Somehow the bald people can't defeat (or even find) the Fremen, but as soon as Austin Butler comes in he can find their shelter immediately and torch the whole thing? The Fremen have these OP laser guns but are still relying on hand to hand combat?I think the movie could also have been a little more helpful to those of us who haven't read the books by reiterating some of the lore and rules of the Dune universe.",positive
388,"I'd already loved seeing the first part in IMAX, but with this second opus, Villeneuve has completely amazed me. The film is even more grandiose than the first, with actors, music, and visuals that are as powerful as ever, memorable and thrilling for over 2.5 hours.Blending religion, politics and romance, Villeneuve's script takes just the right amount of time between action scenes to convey the complexity of Frank Herbert's universe. I left the cinema breathless, having not seen such a complete science fiction film for a very long time.Go to the cinema as soon as you can, because the experience is unique.And for the lucky ones, go for the IMAX!",positive
389,"I got really hyped up after reading some article stating that the film became the highest rated movie on IMDB in history, at that point the article mentioned a 9.4 score which was crazy.Anyway, yesterday I saw the movie at the cinema.The hero's journey seemed too easy, the first 1.5 hours were slow and rather uneventful. I enjoy Sci-fi but I have seen much better. Of course that the scenery, universe of dunes, cinematic effects were amazing. The leading role was really good as well but overall it was easy and lacked that real struggle, uncertainty and surprize.It is worth seeing for sure but there are many elements that lack originality, fights and plots that are lazy and rather without enough context, preparation and coherence.I appreciate the dune universe, the hero's evolution (I like him because I find myself in him but as I said, his evolution seemed written rather than deserved), the scenery .",positive
390,"McDUNE (Diet Edition) Episode: ""The Hollywood Dollar Empire strikes back on creativity, originality, and intelligence, playing it heavy on the safe again and not even trying anything, lest, God forbid, you hesitate and go elsewhere."" ... Did the bold, peculiar, imaginative and complex Dune deserve to become this? Dune has always been out of the mainstream simply because it was weird and that was its grit. But not anymore. Dune became cool, correct and relatable, got a new logo and a silver foil, everything complex and controversial has been cut out, everything weird toned down, everything surreal turned into realistic, everything absurd into ordinary, and the whole thing has been averaged and run through an AI market analyzer so that today's average, squeamish viewer can enjoy it effortlessly and still manage, in a good mood and unburdened by thoughts, to stop at H&M and New Yorker. Star Trek and Star Wars have been milked to the scabs and the masses need a new franchise... I get it when a Marvel comic receives this treatment, but Dune?... And for the over-cautious, collectivist and standardized Hollywood to embark on such an unscrupulous, unapologetically non-correct and alternative subject on the triumph of individualism is like the DPRK deciding to make Orwell's 1984... And people aren't even ashamed to claim Dune as their childhood idol and doing this to it and profiting from it with no scruples... And speaking of 1984 (hint: Lynch's Dune), when you consider that they had three times as much space here, do you feel like they delivered three times as much? Not a chance. And when you consider what options we should have in 2024 and what we actually got in the end, it almost makes me cry.... A mid-budget animated series that would relieve creators of market pressures and allow them to go deeper, that would have dabbled in the psychedelia and eccentricity that makes Dune Dune, and that would have paid homage to Lynch, Jodorowsky, Moebius, Giger, Foss and the entire 60s - that's what Dune deserved, not another boilerplate and self-absorbed blockbuster, of which there are 12 a dozen every year, and which of all the adaptations of Dune (including the unrealized ones) have brought nothing to the table except dollars.",positive

After the first movie I was so happy that Denis Villeneuve did the book justice and prayed that the second would live up to it. It exceeded it by far. I genuinely have no complaints. Despite knowing what was going to happen from reading the books I was on the edge of my seat still questioning the outcome of fight scenes.The casting was spot on, the music was incredible, the visuals were insane, and the cinematography was legendary. I can't wait to see more in the next film.",positive
392,"The perfect crescendo of Dennis Villanueva's directing career. From the raw realism of combat in Sicario to the beautifully immense alien vessels in Arrival. Then the exotic and stunning world of Blade Runner, which only lacked a depth of lore with regards to storytelling. Along with the incredible sound design in each of these films only lacking the originality of lightsabers clashing. DUNE enters the room with the brilliantly crafted ornithopters, the intricate crackle of the shields, and the rattlesnake rumble of an incoming sand worm. Aside from this, the cast is as perfectly selected as Nolan's Batman trilogy, making every character introduction a pleasant surprise and a nod of appreciation for choosing someone so well suited to how you personally imagined they would look and act. Next is the layers of storytelling and depth of plot that really take this movie into the realm of top 10 on the top 250, cementing Villanueva in the Mount Rushmore of trilogy directors and second maybe only to Christopher Nolan. Throw a few Lisan Al Gaib whispers into the chat and some Arrakis DMT and you have a full fledged passion of the Christ meets Qui Gon Gin looking at anakin for the first time. It's honestly on another level..",neutral
393,"Born late to witness Empire Strikes back, too young to understand the hype around return of the king but on time for DUNE part 2.Dune part 2 is a peak cinematic experience specially in IMAX, From the word go you are stuck into the sand of Arrakis and a faith that messiah will save fremen from the violence of emperor.Every Sci-Fi movie audience is prepared for the huge visual scenes, battles, action sequence but it happens rarely that dialogues are given this much importance. And that' where Dune part 2 prevails. Dune shows the importance of proper writing, tight screenplay and visuals done right.Cinematography specially in third act of the movie shows the scale of Greig fraser and that scale is unimaginable. Crisp editing, brilliant score by the Hans Zimmer are cherry on the top.Rebecca Furguson and Zendaya have given a performance of life time. Javier Burdem's performance as Stalgir seems to be funny in first phase of the movie, A faithful servant of the holy folks told about the messiah but as the movie goes by it slowly converts into the horror and that where Javier Bordem and josh brolin's Act seems legit and strong.Austin butler is madness, he shown his peak in those entry sequences.There are no words that are enough to explain the Timothee chalamat as messiah of fremen. Timothee as Paul Atredis is the best casting that has took place. That shift from a hopeful prince to fearful leader of cult is Amazing.Denis Villineuve is a brilliant director. It's his best work till date.Dune part 2 deserves so many accolades this year, watch this movie on the largest screen possible. This movie will change the way we have seen CINEMA.",positive

Only time will tell but for now i am in awe with how much better it was than the first.",positive
396,"This was an utterly fabulous cinematic and spiritual experience. I was drawn into Villeneuve's world by the enormous scale of the design, the undeniable pull of a religious fable, the conviction of the lead players and the power of the sound and visual design.It's strange how often critics (pro or amateur) think that sound and visuals are somehow a mere adjunct to the story; that celebrity actors must all have something worthy to do (cameos are derided); that the politics of casting must be taken into account; that all old stories must have a modern take to make them relevant.Cinema IS moving pictures, and whilst sound is not a requirement, even ""silent"" era classics made good use of music and effects. Story is important, but cinema's unique power is its capacity to move an audience by engaging two of our senses in a most primeval way. Story alone cannot do this.Admittedly, one's hearing does feel at risk at times, but without the awesome sound design, Dune: Part Two would be diminished. I was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of the movie's visceral delivery. This was not some sentimental response to the tale, but a gut reaction to the physical transmission of the themes of power, corruption, revenge, faith, identity - the spiritual battle of Good and Evil. These were, for me, of greater significance than the mere political struggle between the two Houses and the Emperor., which is, in any case, subordinate to the power wielded by the Benegesserit which the Reverend Mothers themselves recognise is not supreme.However, if you want to see parallels with contemporary issues such as the problems of living in a post-imperial world, they are still very visible, and the ""romance"" between Paul and Chani is not a romance at all, burdened as it is with the visions and portents of a Messianic future.I should add that I am neither a fan of the books, having read barely 100 pages of the first, nor, as an atheist, do I adhere to any religious faith. I am, however, a believer in the power of cinema.",positive
397,"This was an enjoyable film, with great sounds and superb special effects.However, despite the fact that a third film is inevitable, there are many questions that should have been answered, and several parts that seemed extremely underwhelming.Although I DID enjoy the film overall, it was FAR from perfect as the end battle was a serious let down, and key characters AND their backgrounds were sadly left to the imagination rather than factored into the story.Characters were also built up, only to be let down so easily. I found that very frustrating, and quite disappointing.There was so much potential, and yet so many missed opportunities that I feel should have been easily seen as a problem during production.Yet the were not.Overall it certainly WAS entertaining, and quiet the price of admission; just not nearly as entertaining as it could have been with proper direction.Hopefully the third part will increase my rating, but unfortunately the errors that currently exist, sadly cannot be corrected now..even with adequate future clarifications.6/10.",positive

Not a single feeling of green screen CGI bonanza.But story and character wise, while not bad, it's just not that engaging. You are never surprised (a problem with sticking close to the well known story). There's a little character development but i would have wanted to see Paul's change with more gradual tension.

Why not use the big gun immediately to take it down, or best use the worm and ride it over. Why run so many people directly at the army. No tactics at all but yet he's praised like a hero.10.

403,"Dune 2 is a masterful continuation of the epic saga set in a captivating sci-fi universe. Building upon the rich lore established in its predecessor, this film immerses viewers in a world of political intrigue, fantastical landscapes, and profound character development.Director Denis Villeneuve's visionary approach brings Frank Herbert's iconic novel to life with unparalleled brilliance. From the sweeping desert vistas to the intricate details of the various factions, every frame is a testament to meticulous craftsmanship.The performances are nothing short of stellar, with each actor fully embodying their respective roles. Timoth√©e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides exudes both vulnerability and strength, anchoring the narrative with a compelling presence. Supporting cast members, including Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, and Rebecca Ferguson, deliver equally captivating performances, adding depth to the ensemble.The visual effects are breathtaking, seamlessly blending practical and CGI elements to create a visually stunning world that feels both authentic and otherworldly. Hans Zimmer's haunting score further elevates the cinematic experience, imbuing each scene with an emotional resonance that lingers long after the credits roll.What truly sets *Dune 2* apart, however, is its thematic depth. Beneath the spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, destiny, and the human condition. As the story unfolds, it poses thought-provoking questions about the nature of leadership, the consequences of choice, and the interconnectedness of all life.In conclusion, Dune 2 is a triumph on every level. It surpasses its predecessor in scope, ambition, and execution, delivering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. A true masterpiece of modern cinema, deserving of the highest praise.",positive

Scenes that could be deemed as slow were acted so well with beautiful cinematic imagery that it flowed so well. Felt like an hour movie - could have stayed for more. Without giving anything away, the worm scenes are goose-bump worthy throughout. So many moments that could be a favourite that my husband and I talked about them for days after. Absolute masterpiece and I really do hope that Timothee Chalamet wins an Oscar for this one as he really does deserve it.",positive

Despite the incredible cinematography, the first film was quite slow going and convoluted in setting up the premise. However, I needn't have worried as part two was a much simpler premise setting up the Paul Atreides' revenge story, but also gave so much action, drama and moment of pure tension. Austin Butler's psychotic portrayal of Feyd-Rautha stole the show but there were also excellent turns from Chalamet, Zendaya and the who's who of Hollywood.What is clear is that Villeneuve does scale better than any of his peers, and when the worms take front and centre in some of the biggest scenes, he shows why he is a master of his art. It really is a film that deserves to be on the big screen and showed once more why we should savour our cinemas before it's too late.",positive
406,"I felt like I was watching cinematic history play out before my eyes. Absolute masterpiece. I can't name a single movie that has shaken me this deeply.I felt like I wanted to be a part of the world - even more than I did when I first watched Avatar in the theater. And, if we're going to compare the two, the visuals and cultural depth in this movie are better. The plot development is leagues ahead, as is the acting.The Christian parallels, in particular, struck me profoundly. As a Christian myself, there were a few scenes when I actually cried. Not for sadness - for sheer awe. Especially when Paul truly assumes his full power. Tingles everywhere.Wow. I'm not even coherent right now.Long live cinema.",neutral
407,"Dune 1 felt a lot like an intro. Beautiful made and created, with a great soundtrack to support that ""mood"". But, without any changes of pace to support that build-up of epicness and suspense into something memorable and climactic.The abstraction and dialogues also prevented me from really being immersed in the movie. I kept in the role of a distant observer, watching some piece of art. Quite relaxing, but not very exhilarating. Something I do expect from an epic telling of Dune.And I can't say that changed much in part 2. Yes, the story continues and becomes a bit more interesting, because we start to move more towards the climax of the story. But the style is still the same. I don't get immersed, I'm just an observer. Again a beautiful and a sort of peaceful experience, where even the battle scenes pass by in an muted dream state.It was only up to +- a half hour before the end there was finally some emotion coming out with a bit more pace. That's also when I knew, he does this not enough. It needs to dance more with different pacings to really make It memorable.So I appreciate the artfulness of the movies. He's created a beautiful and interesting world, but everything inside of It, the people, the life, the story feels muted and dead, like a painting.",positive
408,"I don't write reviews often and almost never use the word 'masterpiece'. I went to see this movie with my youngest son. I always brag to him and others that I went to see Empire Strikes Back in the theatre in 1980. After this movie I turned to him and said ""one day you will brag to your son that you went to see Dune Part 2 on opening day"". We are witnessing the birth an epic movie saga like no other. This is the reason we still go to see movies in movie theaters! AND I will also buy the 4K Blu-Ray when it is available. It is difficult to praise any aspect of this film over others because it can win every category at the Oscars. What a film!",neutral
409,"I was very much looking forward to this movie, since I enjoyed part one. Also because Dennis Villeneuve sets a high standard for himself, I started watching with high expectations, but this movie is not the master piece some claim it to be.Others here have written similar remarks: there is somehow a lack of depth to this movie. The story and the characters are rather shallow, despite the build-up from part one, which seemed to have much more depth. The movie is even rather boring at times.The strong point of the film is that it is visually stunning, although nothing revolutionary. What also struck me is that soundeffect-wise this movie is very similar to other Hollywood blockbusters, which is a let down. I expected more, since the first movie had some very original sound effects.Don't get me wrong, it's not at all a bad movie, it's entertaining at times. But it is definitely not a classic like 'the empire strikes back', as some people claim.",positive
410,"I was sooo captivated by the first movie. And after waiting for the second one for so long (with extra 6 months!), after all of those spoilers in press about how even cooler is to be the second part - I've got THIS O_oIt was like watching a very long film trailer, or a clip: it was chopped into weird episodes that just don't build a narrative, and have no logic. To be honest, I'm not a fan of Frank Herbert's writing, and while I'm amazed with the Dune universe and how he managed to imagine this all, his writing style is horrible (sorry, fans). I loved the first movie specifically because it lets become really a part of this mystery, and this world, and feel it's beauty that Herbert described clumsily.But for the second part - well, it was painful to read the book to follow the logic in there, and it's hilarious to see how scenarists (or maybe video editors) succeeded in making it even worse.Many key episodes are just vanished from the movie. The tremendously important episodes or Jessica and then Paul taking Water of Life and what happened to them, what they saw - Geez, what these barbarians did to those?? Drink - something blue - omg, she's pregnant! - the end. Really???The final battle of Arrakeen is a 5-minute awkward thing.OK, I'm done. It was too bad. Even the visual effects somehow were better in the first movie then here.",positive
411,"Having read the books, and being a huge fan of the first movie, I walked into the cinema expecting a masterpiece. I walked out feeling exactly that. Amazing cinematography, score and stunning performances. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson deserve Oscars.The scenes shot in IR are some of the best cinematography to exist, period. Dune: Part Two captures the essence of the book, and elevates it to an art form that is beautiful, terrifying and utterly breathtaking.There were scenes where the raw power of the film and score led me to tears. This movie deserves Best Picture, and so much more.However, I do have a few gripes. Firstly, the relationship between Paul and Chani was one of calm and trust in the book. Here, it was one of doubt and mistrust. That is a bit sad to see, although it does add significant tension into the relationship, which may become a pivot point in the future.Also, many scenes were omitted, particularly for length decisions. However, not getting to see Hawat, or the decadence of House Corrino and the Golden Line Throne was a bit of a shame.That said, Dune: Part 2 is a work of art. I will be watching this film again and again. It is a reminder of what can be achieved when pure passion and love is dedicated into a rich, complex and beautiful source material.",positive
412,"In a word, WOW!..what an amazing movie...to think that this completed just the first book and there are five others to go. I don my hat to Denis Villaneuve (who deserves an Oscar) and all the supporting costume, production, cinematography & visual effects and anyone else I may have missed...and of course the cast! I'm still a fan of the 1984 version but at long last (30 years) after multiple attemps to buy rights and invest, we finally got a movie house to take the risk. I can safely say that I'd love to see the remaing books come to the big screen. A message for Denis Villaneuve - forget any other projects and finish the Dune one!",positive
413,"I see some people recommending to watch it on the largest screen possible. I agree with them and that's why I decided to go to the Leonberg IMAX cinema in Germany. The largest IMAX screen worldwide. On top of that, one of the VFX supervisors, Gerd Nefzer was there as a special guest. It was an experience I will never forget. The whole theater was shaking during action scenes with intense sound. And of course the movie itself is a masterpiece. It's also significantly better than the first movie. Dune Part 2 is solid proof that good cinema exists and can continue to exist, if the studio executives can give artists a break and allow the creative freedom necessary for such a result.",positive
414,"This was definitely the best movie of 2024, this deserves all the love.The costumes are well designed, and the effects used for the film made it look real, the action brought the hype, and the writing and storyline definitely makes this film peak cinema.Timothee chalamet does a great performance in the film as paul atreides, zendaya does a great performance as chani in the film as well.Well done denis villeneuve, you really made this peak cinema.Hollywood needs this film, This needs to be in fame.Can't wait for dune messiah!Overall rating: 10/10

Did I enjoy this movie: Yes.",positive
415,"This movie is an absolute gem, unquestionably worth every penny of the ticket price. From start to finish, it delivers a truly immersive cinematic experience that will leave you in awe. Every aspect of this film, from the acting to the cinematography to the storyline, is crafted with meticulous detail and expertise.""What a movie, what a movie,"" is a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the sheer brilliance of this cinematic masterpiece. It's a rare find in today's film landscape, where true excellence can sometimes be elusive. From the captivating performances of the cast to the breathtaking visuals that transport you to another world, this movie exceeds all expectations.",neutral
416,"Where to begin... Wow. The scale of this movie surpasses everything: the action, the performances, the music; everything is perfect. The film picks up where the previous one left off to create what could feel like a war behind the screen. It feels so real; emotions flow throughout the projection, from beginning to end.We witness Paul's growth to become the promised Messiah, and as he does, the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chilling.Feyd-Rautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense; he is unpredictable and sadistic, truly relishing it, and Austin Butler portrays him magnificently. But the figure of Paul, played by Timoth√©e Chalamet, feels like oppression itself, of a much more powerful and sinister evil, truly terrifying. Yet his more human side is not overlooked, as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders. To not dwell too much on interpretations, I must simply say that there is not a single one that disappoints; they are all truly magnificent.Hans Zimmer picks up where he left off in the Part One and elevates it, providing a sense of epicness, without neglecting the mystique. The visuals are incomparable; the effects are polished to the smallest detail, making you believe in Dune, in Arrakis, and in the entire world built by Frank Herbert, and shown through Denis Villeneuve's vision.Lastly, regarding this, it can only be said that this great director continues to improve; he always surprises for the better. With this film, he brings his sensitivity, which has already made him stand out, to tell the most epic story of his career, perhaps his greatest challenge, and he has succeeded; what seemed impossible, he has achieved.I truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters; it was a sublime experience. I hope that, just like the book did in its own right, this movie becomes a benchmark for propelling the future of Sci-Fi in cinema.",positive
417,"This is a beautifully made, mostly entertaining film.It does feel that so many movies are now being made to be watched in the cinema - all sound and vision, beautiful cinematography, artistic set pieces, lots of weird booming noises, visual metaphors and if you're lucky great music.Dune 2 is no exception, a rollercoaster ride of a film, a popcorn flix.Unfortunately this all means that the story suffers, becoming either bland and predictable or mysterious without making any real sense.Frank Herbert's Dune creates a complex 'galaxy' with important story elements (the significance of spice in holding the planets/ empire together, the crucial role of the spacing guild that Paul uses to defeat all of his enemies) but this film seems barely aware of them. So much so that it seems they cannot make a sequel worth making. David Lynch's attempt is like a masterpiece in comparison.Having said that, I enjoyed it far more than the first one and I did enjoy watching almost all of it. Great acting and special effects.A really great film to watch at the cinema. Once.",positive
418,"The entire texture of this film is so different from the first, part one with a singular storyline this story fanning out allowing space for characters to unfurl. The pacing moves with these arcs sometimes slowing and at other times hastening but at all times not overdoing exposition and keeping the story moving. The fact that many peripheral characters in part one are given much more screen time is wonderful. I found it of special interest they paid so much to developing out the Fremen culture too so it had its own identity just nothing short of magic.The movie itself is beautiful, the sci-fi immense and strange. Geidi Prime rendered as monochromatic horror. Kaitan lush and decadent. Everything has a visual identity. The beauty of Arrakis made even more dramatic by the terror of the worms and its storms.Politics is at the core of the film though and its interplay with faith, belief and religion. Paul is given a much darker turn his messianic trajectory driving a visible fall from the grace of the Fremen instead an instrument of the political long play of the true power of the Bene Gesserit. Prophecy is depicted instead as corruption of freedom another whip to control the masses. I can't wait to see how this is played out in part three (it has to come too much is left unresolved).This by far is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time and it deserves every accolade it receives.",positive
419,"This is just based solely on the movie. This is a MOVIE reviewing website, after all, not a book reviewing site. Unfortunately, like many modern movies, it looks amazing (the work riding scene alone was unreal), but, it also jumps from scene to scene with no real coherence. I understand a movie is a series of shots edited into scenes that make up a movie. However, the scenes have to flow together to create a coherent narrative. Maybe it's just me, but so many films these days seem to have a disjointed narrative, ie, jumping from scene to scene without the proper flow. This film seems to be no exception. Yes, it is well acted and looks AMAZING, but why can't movies have coherence?",positive
420,"This was an awful waste of time.Yes, as everyone says, it's beautifully shot and looks gorgeous.That's it though. Put the visuals to one side and there's little else to admire.The plot makes no sense and takes liberties just to keep things moving along at oh so pedestrian a pace.Chamalongadingdong and Zendire have zero chemistry between them. Both good actors elsewhere, but way off the mark here. Rather than a leader to be feared, young Tim looks like he just needs spanking and sending to bed with no supper.Walken is tragically under utilised and looks lost in his brief appearances on screen. Given that he's supreme ruler of the universe or something, the Fremen, lead by young Tim, all but just walk up to him and give him a telling off.The final battle is such a disappointment. Blink and you'll miss it. It could have been epic. Instead it's a damp squib. Sandworms against the might of the Harkonen army? It could have been the best bit of the whole film!Won't be holding my breath for part 3.",positive
421,"Dune 2 is a cinematic spectacle that exceeds its predecessor. Visually stunning with breathtaking landscapes, the film masterfully blends sci-fi grandeur with intricate storytelling. The performances, especially Timoth√©e Chalamet and Zendaya, shine, adding depth to their characters. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision is realized through impeccable production design and Hans Zimmer's evocative score. You can really feel that the story the first book wanted to tell is now finished. While the intricate plot may be challenging for newcomers, fans of the genre will revel in its complexity. Dune 2 is a triumphant continuation, setting the stage for an epic saga.",neutral
422,"From acting, to cinematography & art direction, to costumes, to sound and music, this film is an absolute masterpiece. The love story and action sequences are perfectly balanced and paced. Every frame is a stand alone art piece. An incredible love letter to the greatest sci-fi story ever written. All I can say is thank you to Dennis and his team and cast for this wonderful addition to our culture. It will stand the test of time and be a forever classic up there with other epics like Twin Towers, Empire, and Dark Knight. The book that defined the genre has waited over half a century for this well deserved adaptation. Best film of our generation, full stop.",positive
423,"A very complex story told well in two parts. The focus is on the story and the characters not video game explosions or political agenda. I am so stunned by how refreshing this movie is I really can't find any serious criticism. I smell a sequel here and can hardly wait. Yes, there are computer graphics but unlike most movies of recent years they are there to tell the story, what a concept! Story telling is thousands of years old, Hollywood has forgotten what their job is, the story is the message and it's told to entertain the paying audience. I couldn't detect a single DEI character inserted randomly. Ten stars, well done!",neutral
424,"As a film editor and creator myself I have always watched movies from a back stage point of view, trying to work out how they made certain scenes, what sort of editing techniques they may use to build scenes and why. But never really getting lost and pulled in to the story especially with the lack of good movies lately in cinema. It's very rare when a movie is so good that all I can do is just let go of all my own technical observations and truly just enjoy the story. With DUNE: part two I had no choice, it truly pulls you in deep, the story, the characters, everything that's going on around you disappears and all you can think about is what's going to happen next! This is how I know it's a good movie. I highly recommend watching this in the big screen. The music is outstanding. The story is extremely epic and satisfying to witness. Best movie I have seen in years! Even tho I knew this was going to be an amazing film after loving the first story, I was still! Blown away and taken by surprise! Go see it now.",positive
425,Calling Dune Part 2 a masterpiece will be underselling the movie. Dune Part One establishes the world of Dune and its characters in a befitting manner. Part 2 carries all that built up tension and creates yet another magical experience that is perhaps the best adaptation of the book possible.Denis Villeneuve is a magician. The way he brings the world to the screen is nothing short of magic. Each scene is a canvas. Each character chiseled with perfect craftsmanship. Each line of screenplay weaves the movie magic. Each action set piece deserves a standing ovation.And the sound of Dune is an equal compatriot of the stunning visuals that this movie has. Each thumping noise to the whoosing noise of spice in the air bring Arrakis to life.A movie adaptation that should be watched multiple times.,positive
426,"Masterfully directed by Denis Villeneuve, the first chapter of the cinematic adaptation of Frank Herbert's masterpiece, ""Dune,"" opens its doors to a vast and unsettling universe. With meticulous attention to detail and stunning aesthetics, Villeneuve brings to life on the big screen the landscapes of an atypical universe.The film follows the story of Paul Atreides (portrayed by Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet), a young noble who becomes the key to crucial events as his family takes control of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, the only place in the universe where ""melange"" is found - a precious substance that affects the entire known world through its effects.With an impressive ensemble cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, and Oscar Isaac as his father, Duke Leto Atreides, the film shapes its characters in a way that allows the audience to feel a deep connection with this fascinating world. Additionally, the performances of Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Dave Bautista as Glossu Rabban add an extra dimension of intensity and drama.Villeneuve uses his remarkable directing skills to build a tense atmosphere full of mystery and danger. The magnificent visuals and hypnotic soundtrack contribute to creating a captivating and memorable cinematic experience.The novel Dune, considered unfilmable and rightfully so, is somewhat minimalist in its portrayal, which might somewhat bother the ""purists"" of the book series, but the general impression is that Denis Villeneuve has done as much as possible in this regard given the constraints imposed by a film of maximum 3 hours.With a brisk pace and a well-constructed narrative, ""Dune II"" follows Paul's rise amidst the desert tribes and his exploration of his prophetic powers, as well as his confrontation with the imperial and political forces seeking to control him.Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet's performance is surprising, showing the complex evolution of his character as he discovers his true power and assumes his responsibilities as a leader. Meanwhile, the supporting characters continue to shine, and the remarkable acting performances of Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the most successful so far, add depth and emotional tension.Visually, ""Dune II"" impresses with its epic battle scenes and stunning landscapes of the planet Arrakis, while the intense soundtrack contributes to amplifying the tense atmosphere.""Dune I"" and ""Dune II"" represent not only two remarkable films but also an exceptional cinematic adaptation of a monumental literary work.Perhaps a bit more could have been done; my fundamental reproach is that Villeneuve did not even explain through a reference the fundamental premise of the universe he describes, namely the Butlerian Jihad (the war against machines), an event that explains why the Dune universe looks the way it does, why there are no AIs or even computers, what was the fundamental role of spice, what the Guild was, and why it needed this substance found only on Dune, and so forth.",neutral
427,"""It's something is not broken don't fix it"" the story was a literary masterpiece! One of, if not the greatest science fiction novels of all time. The acting was amazing. The special effects amazing. The costume and environmental design were perfect. But the was change so much! A fictional universe such as this is so complex that when you change key things the story won't make sense. Paul and chain's relationship was changed, the time line of the story was changed, main characters were not even in the movie (Thufir Hawat, Count Fenring, Alia Atreides who is Paul's sister who should have been born during this movie and was the character who actually killed the Barron.) They have completely changed the story from what it should be i understand into today's climate you must cater to the most democratic. It's just a shame that literary and intellectual masterpiece such as this wasn't treated the way it should be.Overall the movie was awesome, for someone who has no knowledge of the novel it is a must watch. For fans of the dune novels you may be disappointed.",positive
428,"The best film of 2024, so far. It surpassed its predecessor in many aspects, especially in pacing, visual effects and action. The cast is even grander than its predecessor, talents such as Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walker, Lea Seydoux and Anya Taylor Joy were significant additions to make the narrative even more powerful. It is impossible not to comment on the action scenes, as in the first film there were few and not many were well directed, here Denis Villeneuve corrects this small flaw and delivers breathtaking action scenes, especially the large-scale war (holy war) of the third act of the film, which can easily be compared with the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings franchise. In short, another masterpiece from master Villeneuve! Bring on Messiahs of Dune!",positive
429,"I've been looking forward to this movie, However, I've just watched it and was disappointed at how long and drawn out it was. The first movie was much better, we had a number of people walk out before this movie finished.I can't see how you can possibly give this movie a 10 out of 10. The visuals were good, but it was seriously lacking in action.If you were a fan of the first movie it is worth going to see just to get closure on the story line. It had a lot more potential to be entertaining, but for me it just didn't deliver. It's a shame, the world that was built in the first movie was interesting and I thought I'd love part 2, but sadly didn't.",positive
430,"Every enemy/opponent in this movies are incredibly bad at fight/war. Also these armies supposed to ''conqure'' galactic wide of areas. But they have like 9 helicopters, 500 stromtroopers and a few personal guards with ''swords''.. lol
The only good and passable thing about those 2 movies are visuals but why do people overrate whenever they some some decent visuals? The characters, the dialogs, the action, and storytelling are so incredibly childish that it is unbelievable that writers&director aren't actually 13 years old kids.The characters are especially so bad. None of them suits to ''what they should be''. Maybe because whenever we see a character there's a HUGE dB sound of ''WHAAAAAAAOOOO''. And for the love of god, can anyone tell me what's the deal with Zendeya? She looks like a genz tiktok influencer. None of those ''desert'' people looks like they do live there without water etc. And that BLUE EYES look LAUGHABLE on them.The world is really effed up, isn't it?...since ''Oppenheimer, Barbie, Godzilla, Past lives & Poor things'' are on ''Oscars''? Lootbox & Live service gaming era of movies!",positive
431,"Was able to watch earlier than most, and I gotta say, Denis Villeneuve is definitely a fan of the novels. Several scenes were long, but it never felt boring or dragged out, my attention was always present throughout the whole film, which is impressive, considering the length.I got goosebumps multiple times, but the two most memorable times was first when Paul was riding the worm. It was shot in a way that you as the viewer, especially in the cinema with those Dolby Atmos speakers, feel like you're riding it yourself, unreal.The other time was when all the Fremen was worshipping him, when he truly became the Muad'dib, waking up and being able to see both past and future.To top it all off, the music and scenery is... Ô£ø√º√©¬© off to everyone who worked on this, and my favorite composer, Hans Zimmer. Going to be a blast watching him live soon.",negative
432,"Dune: Part 2 is an incredibly satisfying follow-up to the far less exciting and interesting Part 1. While I was not blown away by Part 1, I would say it is a necessary prerequisite to enjoying Part 2. Is this movie so good that it's worth watching a second, lesser film in order to enjoy it? Yes, unequivocally.While a lot of people are talking up Austin Butler's performance (and believe me, it is awesome), I really feel the shining star of the movie is Timothy Chalamet. Without giving too much away, he has to play almost 3 versions of the same character in this movie, and he frankly hits it out of the park in scenes I was expecting he'd be challenged by. Rebecca Ferguson is also spectacular; her character undergoes a significant change as well. Suffice to say, both Paul and his mom Jessica embrace some darker impulses in this one.Visually, the movie is very impressive. One sequence that takes place off of Arrakis is particularly impressive in the way it is stylized. The sandworms are featured prominently and look great. One scene in particular involving a sandworm was shot practically and the realistic look of the scene really contributes to it as a highlight of the film.Thematically, Dune 2 is about the toxicity of revenge turning good people bad, and the risk of blind faith turning humble folk into dangerous zealots.",positive
433,"Dune Part Two is quite simply a Magnum Opus.A Ben Hur of our times.The movie is so beautiful, so dramatic, so epic, and so mesmerizing and ultimately felt so real from the start to the finish, that only when it ends, only then, that you realise that it was just a movie.Perhaps the first movie which I will rate 10 on 10.Perfection epitomised.Cant wait to watch it again.Must be seen in Imax.Go and see an extraordinary movie and come back humbled.The Sound and the Visuals are extraordinary and better than anything I have ever experienced.Dennis Villeneuve, take a bow.How are you going to top this?!!!Messiah (part 3) has its work cut out.May the force be with you, Dennis.",neutral
434,"The movie is straight up one of the best ever made.During the entire time I was shivering, feeling goosebumps and in the edge of my seat.I already enjoyed the first movie, giving it a nice 8/10 or 7.5/10 but the part two is one of those rare cases where the second film is actually better than the first, and in my opinion by a mile, because this is just a goated film and one of my favorites too, it's in my top 5 easily.Acting was really really good almost flawless.The CGI was goated, really good effects and the explosions were breathtaking.The songs/soundtracks were insane, another Hans Zimmer classic.Plot from what I understand is difference from the books, but in a the movie point of view is perfect nonetheless.",positive
435,"A modern masterpiece filled with incredible visuals, characters, and sound. Saw it at a Fan First Premiere and was blown away by just how good the movie looked and sounded. If you love Sci-Fi and action this movie will more than likely be an instant classic to you. Very curious to see how they adapt Messiah but if the first two are any indications, this trilogy could go down as one of the best of all time.Has really strong performances as well. I loved Bardem (Stilgar) he brought a lot of humor to the movie and even had the audience laughing at multiple points throughout the film. The entire cast and crew did amazing but Chalamet, Zendaya, Bardem, Butler, and Yacoub were the highlights for me. Chalamet during the last hour of the film was literal perfection. It will definitely be one of my favorite films in recent years.",positive
436,"Absolutely an amazing movie. I could not believe 3h went by in the blink of an eye. All of the actors were fitted to their roles perfectly and acted in a convcincing manner. The esthetics of the movie were pleasant, music captivating and special effects generous. There were funny moments in the movie (or maybe it was just me finding it funny). I don't remember last time I've seen a movie this good. Absolute masterpiece!! After it finished I just wanted to carry on and watch it for longer and longer. Now I need to read books as I cannot wait for another movie part to come up which probably will be in another couple of years.",positive
437,"Okay, so let's just reign in this 'hype-train'... Now my rating is probably closer to an 8 (which in the way I rate movies on here, is very, very good) but I feel I just need to help settle down this average that is being blown all out of proportion. Don't get me wrong this movie looks and sounds incredible, but that is where the ""incredible"" ends. There are many sound bites and quotes flying around, which we all know are hand-picked or even 'funded' by the studio, that are going to lead you to believe this is the greatest film of all time...(It isn't). Or that Austin Butler has delivered us one of the greatest movie villains of all time...(He hasn't). These are merely part of the sales pitch. Unfortunately, when you deal with a project such as this that already has a massive following from the books there is no middle ground. The fans will destroy the movie or hail it as the greatest adaptation of all time. These fans, that hold the books in such high regard, feel a sense of ownership, as if they are trying to tell the world ""You see, we were right. You all called us nerds or geeks but now look...."" And they will shout longer and louder until everyone else agrees.Like I said, this is a very good movie, but it is merely the middle.. (spoiler alert, there's gonna be another one!) Now unlike maybe The Dark Knight or Empire Strikes back, I don't know if this is something you would just watch randomly a few years on from now. You would have to set aside the time to make a dedicated effort to watch the whole saga. Which for me, removes it from the 'great movie' conversation.A truly great movie should be something you can watch at the drop of a hat, something you can switch on halfway through and be instantly enthralled because you've seen them so many times. I just see that with this movie. Oppenheimer was the same. A fantastic film, but are you gonna stick it on when you've got a few hours to kill, while you wait for your solicitor to get back to you with the news of how much of your pension your soon-to-be ex wife wants in the divorce settlement...? No. You're gonna grab Flight of The Navigator off of the DVD shelf or City Slickers.I digress. In a nutshell - Great visuals, incredible sound, some good performances although a missed opportunity with Butler's ""greatest movie villain of all time"". Pacing was a bit all over the place at times but overall a more than worthwhile next part to the story. I hope the next part (whether it's the final part or not) delivers too.",positive

439,"So, after the 1st part, I assumed they would make up for it in the 2nd part. However, the changes to the plotline are only there to facilitate a third episode, because there is no closure in the 2nd episode and there are missing elements.I just can't forgive the total absence of the ""Weirding Way"". One of my favorite parts to the 1984 movie is when Paul doesn't even need a weirding module. (which isn't in the book). The glossing over of the Spacing Guild Navigators, and even their appearance is weak. The fact that spice is required for interstellar travel is also ignored so that a horrible, unnecessary choice is made near the end of the movie. Alia's contributions are mostly missing as are some of Paul's interactions with the Bene Gesserit. The fight between Paul and Feyd is less dramatic.The big scenes are well shot and beautiful. Not all of the plot changes are bad. I thought the more time spent on opposing factions within the Fremen was good and more realistic.Bottom line, in spite of the few improvements, I felt there was less drama, and many lapses. I like the 1984 film better.",positive
440,"Dune is no Game of thrones (I understand that) but imagine how terrible it would've been if GOT was just a movie/s and Battle of b*stards was shown in 2 minutes scene. Reverse it and imagine if Dune was a TV show. The romance between Paul and Chani were developed through episodes, the acceptance of paul into the Freman world were properly established,a thrilling fight between Paul and Feyd and so many other things; it could've not only made total sense but also would've connected to the audience and done a justice to the story.As many people have said and in my opinion-Dune:part two is simply boring, despite having the stunning visuals and amazing score. Denis Villeneuve has put more focus on aesthetics than genuine storytelling and it does the real damage. Pacing of the movie is irregular where it tries to crammed lots of information in few scenes in the middle, the ending is simply filling and unsatisfying.One big reason that it falls flat is because it tries to put few books worth of story into 2h46m. Some die hard fans are pulling their hair that(as per the books) it fails to describe the reasoning behind many things or it's a wrong story, And To the first time viewer it seems Just another story of two sides fighting, nothing more.Depth in the story , development of character arcs and suspense are the few things that could have make it great TV,but that requires time for thr story of this scale. Which could've only done it by making it a show. As a movie it feels rushed.",positive
441,"The first movie was incredible, this installment was epic, one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life thanks to a great director and the actors, it is a work of art. We look forward to Dune 3. The soundtrack is incredible, we must support this incredible sequel that has not given an incredible story that will be unforgettable. It is also a film that does not completely involve the actors, which keeps us in front of the screen, super interesting, excellent acting, excellent cast. I loved the drama, let's continue supporting this type of movie which is fabulous and does not have any type of waste from beginning to end, it is epic, let's go for more movies like this which marked this year 2024 and deserves many awards.",positive
442,"With the rise of streaming services and the quality of what is being put out from those platforms, it is most important if you are a fan of cinema to experience this movie in the next few weeks, potentially multiple times. Denis Villeneuve has accomplished a great task of bringing Dune to the big screen! The second part of the adaptation has only improved on the world building and visuals from the first. The story is rich and fast paced while not devolving into a convoluted and confusing mess. A few standouts of the story besides the obvious Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya were Javier Bardem and Rebecca Ferguson. The movie left we wanting for more, even after its almost 3 hour runtime. If you want quality films to continue being made, Dune: Part Two is the film that will cement your admiration of this medium.",positive
443,"The film ""Dune 2"" is a cinematographic work that impresses in several aspects. From the gripping soundtrack to the brilliant scenes and footage, the production captivates the viewer from start to finish. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet's performance stands out, adding a layer of depth to the character.When watching the movie, the experience is engaging and exciting. The expectations created by the critics are surpassed, leaving the public eager to review the work. The harmony between Villeneuve's vision and Hans Zimmer's music is remarkable, contributing to the immersion in the narrative.In short, ""Dune 2"" is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed in theaters. With impeccable performances, a striking soundtrack and stunning scenes, the production stands out as a true work of art. Now it remains to look forward to the third film and continue to marvel at all that ""Duna"" has to offer.",positive
444,"First, a few words on the IMAX presentation I saw in Geneva, Switzerland (Balexert cin‚àö¬©mas). Certainly spectacular, but the Dolby Atmos presentation is pretty earth shattering -- and ear shattering -- in the action sequences. Wear concert earplugs or be prepared to cover your ears for part of the film since permanent hearing damage is a risk if volume levels are like those in the presentation I saw.As for the film. Bottom line. The day after watching Dune Part Two, I wanted to watch it again. I recently re-watched Dune Part One on my home system (55 inch OLED TV and Dolby Atmos soundbar). I picked up significant character and plot detail that I'd missed on my initial viewing. I expect I will have the same experience with Dune Part Two. There is a lot in this film -- but even at 2 hours, 45 minutes a few things that were missing.The visuals are amazing. No CGI artifacts I could see -- in contrast to an IMAX 'Kong v. Godzilla' trailer that ran just before the film. Incredible world-building, as in Part One. Everything appears very natural, even when the settings are strange, other-worldly.This is a film without a dull moment. Every scene is critical to the story's forward movement. That movement is relentless. For me, that was a problem. Not everything was explained to my satisfaction. These weren't exactly plot holes, but rather plot ellipses.I hope Villeneuve produces a longer -- at least 3h -- director's cut that gives the film a bit more room to breathe and the characters a bit more depth.Still, the actors inhabit their characters completely. The story is riveting. There is plenty of dramatic tension -- even though you know how the film will end if you are even vaguely familiar with the source material.Villeneuve hasn't produced his masterpiece ... yet. I'm looking for a bit more depth and complexity. I understand that Dune Messiah -- which hasn't yet been approved by Warner, but which looks a certainty -- will provide that. Villeneuve, his actors and audience will get a chance to really unpack and dismantle the messiah myth. In any case, in Dune, parts one and two, Villeneuve and cast have planted the seeds for what could be sci-fi's top film trilogy of all time.",positive
445,"People far more elloquent than me have already explained why this movie is so good.All I will say is that I can count on one hand the number of times I've left a cinema feeling like I was part of an experience. I can't remember the last time I experienced so many spine-tingling moments from truly astounding scenery and cinematography, harrowing depth and gravitas, immersive action sequences, and epic Fremen dialogue.After so many years of being lectured by hollywood with poor scripts and miscast actors, Dune is a welcome reminder that all is not lost. Hopefully film studios take note and realise what happens when you trust a director and his team to understand source material and do their best to accurately put it on the big screen (although I will say that it wasn't 100% accurate).In summary, amazing movie. Go watch it.",positive
446,"I'm utterly speechless after witnessing Dune Part 2, it is truly a masterpiece. Every aspect of this sci-fi work of art is beyond remarkable. The world-building is so meticulously crafted, and the visuals and sound are simply breathtaking, trust me when I say I cannot believe my eyes. I was completely swept away by it all and can't wait to dive back in for another viewing. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, make sure to see it on the biggest screen with the most incredible audio setup you can find. My own experience in 70mm Dolby Atmos was nothing short of a life-changing experience - it's truly the pinnacle of cinematic brilliance.",neutral
447,"After I read the book, saw the other movies and Dune part one I was expectin to see a good movie.I was a little bit desapointed about it as it is a very slow placed movie. Acting is quite bad in some scene and the corrography needs to be improved for sure.Freemen were formidable warriors, higly skilled and though. I this movie they are not depicted as strong and looking at the movie again it seems that the fighting sceene are very poorly designed.THe music is very nice, creating a good atmosphere and there are good creathed caracthers but i think the 5 hours movie Dune is way better. The main caracther is weak and poorly playd. Zendaya, Stilgar and the Mother are better created characters.I was a litle bit dissapointed.",positive
448,"This film is an epic, action-packed Sci-fi experience. Denis Villeneuve goes all out in this second part of what looks to be one of the best Sci-fi film series (if not one of the best film series) ever.The film starts unpacking the amazing story of Dune where the previous film introduced us to. It is not neccesary to see part one to enjoy this film, but it definetly makes the experience more complete. Villeneuve took everything from part 1, but made it bigger and better.Where the previous part was lacking on emotional level and action, this one completely makes up for it in it's 2 hours and 45 minutes runtime that feel less. It is filled with more depth in the story with as main point the struggle of Paul chosing between his foreseen destiny and his own loving desires, while getting revenge together with the Fremen for the brutal destruction of his family.To top it off this film comes with a couple of plottwists that keep you at the edge of your seat, aswell as new characters portrayed by an amazing cast that give outstanding performances together with the great already known cast of Dune Part One.All in all, this is a must watch for every film fan, especially in cinemas where Hans Zimmer takes you straight to Arrakis with his once again otherworldy, amazing score.Dare I say this second part of the Dune film series comes close to perfection. 10/10.",positive
449,"I do t get it, the movie was epic and stunning to watch, but it lacked plot and agency.It feels like the first thing that happened was after the first hour. If I walked into the cinema after one hour, I wouldn't have missed a single point of the story.There was even a great recap of the first movie in part 2, so that I almost didn't need to have watched it.With the slow walk to the predictable point of no return, the movie still managed to feel very rushed in the end.At the base it was a great story, but way too long. Why even spend so long time with side characters that doesn't impact the movie much?This is a movie that actually could have used a montage of character development instead of the torture of time just passing by.",positive
450,"It's the worst movie I've watched in a long time.If someone who never saw a previous 1984 film or read a novel watches this one would not understand a thing because there is no logical explanation between some of the events like when Paul's sister appeared all of a sudden and no explanation how or why. The movie itsef is very slow and boring.The main actor looks like a whiney teen aristocrat instead of a strong young man. Even physically he doesn't look like someone who can stand a real fight or lead the whole nation.In the novel Paul Atreides is extremely disciplined and confident in every thing he does. All of his actions and words are deliberate and precisely controlled, and it is this that makes him the super human being - Kwisatz Haderaca. The spice awakens his abilities but doesn't transform him into someone else.Total waste of money and time.",negative
451,"For everyone wondering if they should watch this. YOU SHOULD!Epic in all ways, not a single second wasted not bored. The way it continues to build its story brick by brick, also enjoying a massive plot twist along the way. Wonderfull acting carries this well written story. Every 1 in the cinema was either gasping or laughing which contributes to this being an epic movie.Rush to the cinema to support part 3Ô£ø√º√≤√π. It left on a high note and thus it is meant to end in a high note aswel. Strap in and enjoy!Looking forward to the story beyond, cuz you know the sky is the limit. Cheers and have fun guys!",neutral
452,"I literally think that this is my first complex movie that I love. It never gets boring, perfect plot twist I just feel that I need to cry. The end was so depressing but logical. Paul did something very unexpected and disappointing but that's what you get when you drink that blue beberage so chani did what she needed to do but still I hope he feels bad and goes back with chani and doesn't marry the other girl. I'm sad because a bad symbolic character died which good but I wanted to see him in the next movies because he was a very good antagonist. Thank you for reading this.Pd: I haven't read the books.",positive
453,"Best fiction movie ever by far.All the characters, special effects, storyline. The emotions, music and sounds are just amazing. The team has outperformed any high expectation. If you have a chance watch videos explaining the major houses, characters and story line it can help to make the experience even better. It is hard to leave a movie and think it is flawless but that is what dune 2 did. The battles scenes creates real photograf effects, how they edit the main oarts of the book and put it together also awesome job. Cant wait for the next one. Some people can understand the dark side of human beings, the psychology, love, fear and power. Dune is one of a kind, dostoevsky of ficction book.",positive
454,"""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of Denis Villeneuve's epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic novel. With its sweeping visuals, gripping performances, and thought-provoking themes, it cements itself as a standout achievement in modern science fiction cinema.From the sweeping deserts of Arrakis to the intricately designed sietches of the Fremen, every frame is imbued with a sense of otherworldly beauty and danger. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that each location feels distinct and alive, adding depth to an already immersive narrative.For maximum immersion in ""Dune: Part Two,"" I really recommend watching detailed recap of its predecessor on youtube. Familiarity with the characters, factions, and events from the first part enriches the experience, improving understanding of the sequel's intricate plot and character dynamics.Lisan al Gaib!",neutral
455,"My imagination has come to life on the screen. I didn't think it was possible. The books were profound and intricate. The film just about did it justice with the caveat that it didn't have time to go into detail about the effect of the Water of Life on Paul's unborn sister Alia. This has obviously left the door open for another film! Riding the Worms was something you could only dream about and there it was! Right before my eyes! Fabulous and euphoric. The characters are perfectly imagined and portrayed. The tension in the screenplay was palpable, so much so, I couldn't speak for a while when the film ended. Film?! That word hardly expresses the experience. It was reality. It surrounded and enveloped you, plunging you into the world of Arrakis. The lasting impression was not that I had been in a fictional world but I had visited another planet and seen that good and evil is universal.",positive
456,"Epic filmmaking! Cinematography at its best! It's been a while since i 've seen a really good movie. Attention to details, character development, great casting, great photography and absolutely perfect soundtrack ( Hans Zimmer i don't know how you do it but you 've done it once again). Also the sound effects are so masterfully made that take your breath. I had missed this kind of movie. I love the atmosphere this director makes at his films, it has a slow captivating aroma as if you almost taste the spice itself. The only negative about this movie is that we have to wait now for at least four years for the next one...",positive
457,"This is actually one of the few movies where I didn't necessarily agree with the high ratings. I was very excited about this sequel. Part 1 was pretty great. I'm sad I just didn't agree with what most people thought about part 2. I enjoyed the movie overall but since I didn't read the books, I was fairly confused and bored throughout the first half of the movie (besides the beginning scene) but I really did like the 2nd half though. Probably got more interesting after Austin Butler's character rolled in, honestly. Pacing. I think the pacing was weird as they could've fleshed out the relationships, training, and yeah... basically the story more. It's just not convincing compared to the first movie. I didn't feel much for the characters nor did I care for them. I didn't even care for Chani and Paul's romance. And it's like wow.. Paul is already attempting to ride the worm? It's so dangerous and he's already succeeded on his first attempt. He's THAT gifted. There were mentions of training but really no show. I mean, Paul was basically told to survive through the dessert as a test and learns how to sand walk better but that's... it. The movie simply shows the major parts but nothing much in between to build it up. It was also like watching two different movies in one and now the ""good"" side is gonna ambush and fight the ""bad"" side. I don't feel the movie did a good job of making me want to root for Paul and the fremen. I hope I'm explaining my gripes about this film well.Many big name actors/actresses. Timothee is always a good pick for these type of roles. Austin Butler's character was cool. He did a good job with the character too. I like Zendaya but she's not that great of an actress. Dave Bautista's character was poorly written. All he does is yell and get frustrated then kills one of their own to make them look like very bad enemies. So cliche. I could also barely hear/understand some of the lines which was an irk. It was especially difficult to understand Stilgar because of the accent. The cinematography was beautifully done though. Just wow. I do look forward to the sequel and am interested to see what happens next at least.",positive
458,"Went to see Dune part 1 about 4 times, will do the same with part 2, the acting is spot on and the whole story invites you to want to discover more and more about this whole new universe and environments. Part 2 did live up to the expectations in my opinion, the questions i've had after seeing part 1 were answered and part 2 has made me curious about seeing more. Sad to say i have not read any books just yet so i'm excited to learn about the other houses, planets and unfolding of the story. It was a long sit but well worth the while. Now lets hope for a quick part 3 arrival, i can't wait to see more of Dune!",neutral
459,"I wanted to love this movie as much as the first but felt it lacking in some areas.The positives:
The cinematography and editing are superb, the music almost as good as part one, the sound and visual effects are stunning and Villeneuve has again proven himself to be a top notch director. This must be watched on the big screen for sure.The mixed:
The acting varies in quality with performances ranging from excellent (Bardem, Chalamet, Ferguson, Butler), average (Zendaya, Skarsgard) to forgettable (Walken, Bautista). The pacing is also a bit hit and miss, with some parts/scenes feeling rushed (the ending, Paul's transformation into Lisan al-Gaib).The bad:
Why, oh why did they completely ruin the relationship between Paul and Chani? It's a key part in the book! She supports him 100% in his decision to marry Irulan and his rise to power. Is it because she must be seen as a 'strong and independent woman'?The Harkonnens have become cliched comic book villains, far from the intelligent, sinister and calculating antagonists of the first movie. Virtually nothing is seen of the emperor and Irulan. They may as well not be in it.The timeline is crammed into about 6 months rather than almost 3 years, meaning that Alia isn't born yet so Paul, not she, kills the baron. Why?! As a two year old she plays a key, and powerful role in the book.After reading some of the 10/10 reviews I'm guessing that many have needed a quality movie like this after the dross of recent years and might be getting a bit carried away in their enthusiasm!",positive
460,"The first one was nearly perfect, a 9/10 movie, was hooked from the first till the last scene, but what is this? The pacing, the jumps in story/time, the first hour of the movie is absolutely poinless and could have been done in 20 minutes, not 1 hr. Gives no explanation to whats going on, just pushes characters in and out of the story/situation when needed.The CGI wide shots we great, Harkonens were the best part but were on screen a small amount.Feyd-Rautha was absouletly the peak of the film and he is also basically meaningless and just breazes trough the movie without any significant impact. The final battle carries little emotional impact.After a magnificent Dune 1 we got this sub-par bore of a movie and it is absolutely scary to see just how peoples standards for good movies/art have fallen. People glorify this as a masterpiece, when it is far from it. Decades of sub par art will do that.5/10.",positive
461,"Here is the best part about seeing Dune: Part Two in cinema-it almost didn't happen. It was the last day of the showing at my cinema, and my sister was late I wanted to experience this in the cinema and at last, I did and it was spectacular. It's funny how I have so many words, yet no words at all to describe the feeling of watching this masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve is one of a kind. His vision transcends into this, and please, I am begging you to give this man all awards ever.It's visually special for sure, but the actors...well they act.Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet once again proves that he is the leader of the new acting generation. He is mature and serious and we see his process of growing and changing.Rebecca Ferguson & Austin Butler are probably two of the biggest standouts in this film (along with Chalamet. In every scene, they are in their command. I am looking forward to seeing Florence in the third part because she is the force.Need to mention the score because wow, Hans Zimmer just won his second Oscar for this film.It's a masterpiece.",positive
462,"Best movie I have seen in over 20 years. Great experience by great actors and direction. I highly recommend you see this film. Best war scene and action taking place in a sci-fi universe. The build up from the first movie, set this movie up for great success and character development. Looking forward to seeing how this movie raises the bar on future films in the genre to come.

464,"Souheila Yacoub truly stood out to me in this movie for some reason. Though her role wasn't extensive, whenever she shared the screen with Zendaya, she captured my attention effortlessly. The power emanating from her face, her eyes, her grin was undeniable. Her transformation from unbeliever to believer was portrayed with such depth. I couldn't help but shed a tear when her character passed away in the movie.I was personally happy after having a barren desert of senseless movies to finally have something to look forward to. But I must admit that after rereading the books, the timeline has changed a lot. This is not a true adaptation of those books, be aware of that.Dune: Messiah will show whether or not he will be faithful to the books or whether he will change the story completely.There are problems:
Christopher walken is really miscast as the emperor, the emperor is not weak, he is a politically savage animal. Chani is a strong female, she accepts paul is stronger (female and males are not equal). She accepts their culture is a culture of need and not wants, she is not even mad when paul takes the daughter's hand(this is only political not emotiona, you will have my name and nothing else). Stilgar is not a religious zealot. There is no change between the northren fremen and the southern ones, yes there are more zealous ones. Paul inherits Janis's wife and spouse.",positive
465,"Absolutely incredible story and one of the best sequel movies that comes close to The Empire Strikes Back! Visual stunning thanks to the cinematography of Grieg Frasier. The visual effects and sound designs were amazing and shook the theater. The character dynamics between Paul and Chani from being star crossed lovers from different worlds slightly matches from the book but some story changes were made from the book as well, however it kept with the consistency with the narrative of the first film. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a magnum opus of a film and I'm hoping that he gets greenlit for Dune Messiah.",positive
466,"Not even being a Frank Herbert fan, I thought this was one of the best films I've ever seen, and the story is so incredible. I was blown away by every aspect of this film. The sheer scale of the world they live in is incredibly well displayed on the screen in both Part 1&2. Every actor and actress absolutely killed it with their performance, and it kind of felt like Part 1 was blowing up a giant bubble, and part two was when the bubble popped. I mean everything comes together so nicely in the second part, and Denis Villenueve clearly had a passion for this movie and it shows. I will definitely be seeing this in theatres again. Probably the best movie I've ever seen.",positive
467,"Like Part 1, no complaints can be made about design or imagination. Unlike Part 1, the entire cast are off their game.Chalamet works to either keep a perfectly flat Instagram-affect, or is barking in a comical Batman voice. Zendaya maintains a single expression throughout the entire film of anger/hurt/distrust. Any chemistry between the two of them in Part 1 is gone entirely here.Pugh barely has any lines but reads the ones she has like she's in a police lineup. Pretty much everything hangs on Bardem, Who is the emotional rock the film rests on. Not because that's his role in the story, but because he's the only seemingly real person here.The Emperor's role is to be weak, not to overshadow the Baron. As such, Walken is totally restrained, and functions as more of a look than anything else.It's gorgeous, it's true to the books, some of the sequences are fantastic, I just felt completely detached from it at all times.",positive
468,"Think back at every generation and their iconic films. I was 15 when I watched the Dark Knight and this, Dune part 2 is my the movie of my generation. Everything good about this movie is what makes the Dune series the most rich story in scy fi. I left the movie theater after watching this movie. Thinking that Villanue has really made something of himself. A director of this caliber only comes once in a lifetime and I'm so glad that he has decided to take the mantle of sci fy. If you're interested in the story of the june universe , I highly recommend reading the box and dive in full end until this rich rich world. I know we will all be waiting for Dune messiah.",positive
469,"Like the first film of this two part adaptation of Frank Hebert's sci-fi classic, 'Dune: Part Two' was a very mixed bag for me. On a technical level it's brilliant. Easily one of the best looking films of this century. If nothing else, director Denis Villeneuve sure knows how to shoot a movie. I just wish he were better at telling a story.His 'Blade Runner 2049' was also gorgeous, but it suffered from being cold, soulless and without any real sense of purpose. Unlike the latter, 'Dune: Part Two' has a purpose (thanks to whatever is left here from Frank Herbert's vision), but it also lacks any semblance of emotion or genuine humanity. It somehow manages to be both epic and flat. Quite a feat, but not one to be proud of.The film is also tragically miscast. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet finally starts to rise to the occasion in fits and starts once he becomes ""the one"", but everyone besides Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem are just dreadful. Enough can't be said about how awful Zendaya is here. Even in her wheelhouse she has the range of a spitball, but she's in way, way over her skis on this one. And don't get me started on Christopher Walken as the Emperor. Christopher Walken?! Are you kidding me! This needed an actor with some gravitas and regality. Walken feels far too contemporary for this sort of thing.Look, 'Dune' is my favorite novel of all-time, and my cool reaction to the first part of this adaptation is why it took me nearly six months to watch this. It's not the changes that bother me, save for the ending with Chani, which is an unforgivable sin in my opinion. It's that this whole thing ends up feeling like a pretentious, preening bore instead of the grand spectacle space opera it should have been.",positive
470,"It's remarkable how much praise this film has received. The novels are complex, political, emotional, and captivating. The first Villaneuve film of 2021 was very slow and sullen but had a certain elegance at times, if one could sit through it (I had to pause every fifteen minutes). In Part Two, however, the plot has been altered in unnecessary and absurd ways, and drama, complexity, and interest have been drained, sacrificed to three hours of CGI and cardboard acting. The good cast sound like they're sight-reading their lines. Villaneuve has been quoted as saying that he doesn't like rehearsing actors. But if one expects a thematically driven story like this to emerge, I'm afraid it's the people, not the effects, that are critical. Timothee' Chalamet's monotone, rhythm-free delivery--his only style, is no help.It's extremely ironic that David Lynch's 1984 Dune was so roundly panned (and to be fair, it is not good) while this chaotic, gray, interminable yawn-fest has received almost universal accolades; at least the Lynch film had quirkiness and character. Frank Herbert, author of the Dune novels, is reported to have liked the Lynch film. I hardly think he would have approved of this sluggish travesty.",positive
471,"The film series has something for everyone, compressing the lore and technology of the Dune universe into a digestible byte for most to consume. It displays well the issues within hierarchal systems, as well as the obligations of station foisted on others by technology, group pressure, and otherwise. Lastly, the performance is one that will last in the mind; it does the Dune universe justice from bottom to top, elegantly displaying the natural conclusions of a variety of warring ideologies in terms of maximal culture,development, in descent and ascent. Fantastic performance from all involved.4.",positive
472,"You won't regret if you watch Dune:Part two! Usually I don't write reviews, but it's impossible to not say how amazing this film is. Even if you are not sci-fi fan, you should watch this masterpiece!The huge effort of the director, the whole team who invented the decors and costumes and the amazing work of the actors are making this film unforgettable!I think the second part is even better than the first one and for this contributes mostly Austin Butler! Also the music, written by Hans Zimmer makes the audience feel deep emotions. It's unique I continue to listen the song after watching the movie.Definitely one my favourite films!",positive
473,"By far the best filmmaking, world building, & character development I have ever seen in cinema. It brings forth everyday social issues, complex psychological questions, & spiritual tension all into one. The sound & action captures you into a world that seems very much like ours but with the twist of a galactic empire. Each character is created to bring their own sense of theatrical value. The cinematography is brilliant. Does not feel like CGI whatsoever. Almost felt too real at times. I'm captured, dumbfounded, deep in thought & absolutely mesmerized by this franchise. This film really blew my mind & I will be rewatching it again. GO SEE IT ASAP. NOW. THIS. IS. REAL. CINEMA.Maybe the best movie ever made?",positive
474,I had been eagerly waiting in anticipation for this movie and was not disappointed. It is visually and sonically stunning and has a great pace. The fact that both fremen and harkonnen spoken language were used for dialogue increased the immersions.Some fans of the book who will have a more fundamentalist approach to the source material might struggle a bit with a few deviations. While I perfectly understand the changes to make sure it is became a story that was capable to be captured on film I definitely struggled on a few parts.It does however honor the source and it's an amazing ride to experience!

475,"Not only is Dune: Part Two one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, but it is also set to go down as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. It brilliantly excels in and exceeds all of the aspects that made the first film so good, and truly represents modern filmmaking at its best.The direction and screenplay are exceptional. Denis Villeneuve has done an incredible job adapting a book that many thought was impossible to film.The score, cinematography, action sequences and visual effects establish the grand scale of this mesmerizing motion picture (Everything practically screams Academy Awards!), and the star cast is top-notch. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet gives a formidable leading performance, Austin Butler portrays a compelling antagonist, and the rest of the cast is impressive, but the standout for me definitely was Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica (who I hope receives a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the upcoming Oscars).I absolutely can't wait for Dune: Messiah!P. S. Don't miss the chance to see it in IMAX; it offers an exhilarating experience.",positive
476,"This is my first and only review. The film was so good i felt compelled to share my opinion. I saw the 1984 version and loved it as a kid so i was lookimg forward to see if the 2021 and it surpassed my expectations so much i feared part 2 would fail to deliver, but it delivered and so much more.the 2 hours 40 passed by in a jiffy. Im in awe, speachless and in lack of words. I sat quiet in the car all the way home and so did my spuse and kid of fourteen years. It was amazing and a mindblowing experience for the wole familiy. Go see it om the big screen and get the full experience. I loved it so much I am thinking about seeing it one more time on the big screen before it is taken down.",positive
477,"Man. Cool to look at but not much going on underneath. Maybe should have been epic TV series like game of thrones. They left SO much out. A lot if good stuff. I know most people haven't read the books but this was really the cliff notes version. I liked the first half but the overall pacing was way off. The last 45 minutes things happened so fast it was like blam blam blam then its over. Where's the kid witch. Wheres the weirding way. Wheres the guild. Somehow they made it seem small. Walken was a pretty non threatening emperor. Almost like an snl skit. Sigh, another unwilling messiah story? I half expected Danaerys to show up on her dragon. I dunno. Guess I am just getting old and jaded. And all this tech but still fighting with swords. The shielding tech isn't really explained so the swords seem dumb. I didn't feel much romance from the leads. It's not explained whats bad about drinking the blue stuff while pregnant. And the music wasn't great either. During romantic scenes it sounded like cheesy 80s sci fi jazz ha. And the final knife fight was pretty lame and hard to tell what was happening. Couldn't they get the the john wick fight choreographers? It was fine but underwhelming overall. Feels like I have seen all this so many time before. It is also easy to overlay a lot of parts from the last jedi which everyone hated. I think maybe the heros journey has been completely wrung dry. Unfortunately.",positive

479,"Dune: Part Two is on par with the first in nearly every aspect. However you felt about the first one is likely how you will feel about this sequel. It's a visual and auditory explosion of beauty and the technical aspects are all pristine. Directing, cinematography and music are elite. And they continue to build the cast with great new additions.But just like with Part One, the lack of story progression is noticeable. We don't get the ups and downs of a three-act structure. It feels like one act stretched out to 165 minutes. Again we don't seem to really have a climax. I didn't feel the emotional resonance or investment in the story and characters. And I didn't entirely grasp character motivations, like why a character does something or why another is upset about it.With Part One, I was a lot more forgiving of it not being able to completely stand on its own. But now it's getting a little frustrating. Also, the PG-13 limitations are glaring.(1 viewing, early fan screening IMAX 2/25/2024)",positive
480,"I actually enjoyed Part I more than this. One hour in, I had to check the time. There's only so much time that can be spent on explaining that Charlamee is the savior.The bright spot was definitely Javier Bardem, great performance for an otherwise banal cast of actors. Don't get me wrong, the visuals were outstanding, and the story had its moments, but overall it was frankly boring.This was a big disappointment because it got off to a really good start and in the first hour, the editing and immersion was on point. But once they entered Austin Butler's character, it fell apart.Cringeworthy character development and cliched storytelling at its finest, but I'm sure younger people and newbie sci-fi fans will love it. This is no masterpiece, not even close. Part I was actually better overall.4/10.",positive
481,Went into this with big expectations and was still blown away. The greatest cinematic experience i've had in my lifetime. If you haven't seen this. Do yourself a favour and see it in the biggest screen near you. Denis' ability to give his films scale was taken to a whole new level in this epic. The weight of the movie is felt in full force with an incredible rumbling score throughout. Masterful Editing & Incredible plot makes this a contender for top 250 movies of all time. This is what Hollywood needs. Saw this movie 6 hours ago and I'm still completely blown away. Adrenaline for days.10/10 !!!!!,positive
482,"In the realm of science fiction, few sequels have managed to eclipse the grandeur and depth of their predecessors. However, ""Dune: Part Two"" not only meets this elusive challenge but soars beyond, delivering a cinematic experience that is as colossal in its narrative ambition as it is in its visual spectacle.Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal work continues with a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, weaving a tale that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intricacies of human emotion and power. The film picks up seamlessly from where the first installment left off, plunging the audience back into the arid yet awe-inspiring landscapes of Arrakis1.The story's hero, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), is now fully entrenched in the world of the Fremen, the indigenous people of Arrakis. His journey from a naive young duke to a leader hardened by the realities of interstellar politics and war is portrayed with a sensitivity that belies the epic backdrop against which his story unfolds. Chalamet's performance is nuanced, capturing the internal struggle of a man caught between destiny and desire2.Rebecca Ferguson returns as Lady Jessica, whose strength and complexity are given even more room to shine in this sequel. Her portrayal of a mother and a political powerhouse is compelling, adding layers to a character that could easily have been overshadowed by the grandiose setting and plot1.The film's antagonist, House Harkonnen, is depicted with a grotesque opulence that is both repelling and fascinating. Stellan Skarsgard's Baron Harkonnen is a figure of nightmarish tyranny, his presence on screen as commanding as it is chilling2.Villeneuve's direction is masterful, balancing the intimate moments of character development with breathtaking set pieces that showcase the film's staggering budget and technical prowess. The battle scenes are a particular highlight, with the director's use of scale and perspective creating a sense of immersion that is rarely achieved in cinema1.The cinematography is nothing short of revolutionary. Each frame is a painting, a carefully crafted composition of light and shadow that brings the alien world of Arrakis to life. The use of color, from the deep blues of the Fremen eyes to the golden sands of the desert, is deliberate and evocative2.The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is a character in its own right. It is both haunting and heroic, underscoring the film's themes of legacy, loss, and the relentless pursuit of power. The music elevates the visual storytelling, creating an atmosphere that is immersive and emotionally resonant1.""Dune: Part Two"" is not without its flaws. The pacing, while mostly deliberate, occasionally falters, and some may find the film's adherence to the source material a hindrance to its narrative momentum. However, these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a triumph of science fiction filmmaking2.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a monumental achievement. It is a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible, not just for the sheer scale of its visual ambition but for the depth of its storytelling. Villeneuve has crafted a sequel that not only honors Herbert's vision but expands upon it, creating a work that is both a fitting tribute and a standalone masterpiece. This is a film that deserves not just ten stars but a place among the pantheon of science fiction classics.",neutral
483,"Seriously find yourself a friend that believes in you and hyped you up like Stilgar does to Paul.Having rewatched the part 1 just yesterday, Part 2 is a step up of everything it's predecessor had to offer.Timothee Chalamet is brilliant, he seriously stepped up, his portrayal from a guy who just wants to fight for his people to embracing his messiah destiny is perfect,Zendaya is absolutely phenomenal her character is the most interesting in the whole movie.Rebecca Ferguson is Masterful she becomes terrifying, Javier Bardem is a fantastic hyphenated and Austin Butler as the maniacal Feyd-Rautha is amazing, I just wish we could have seen more from him.Hans Zimmer simply can't miss, his score his simply amazing. It's brings this space epic into a whole new bigger scale than the first, I'm no Lisan Al-Gaib, but I see another Academy Award in his future.Greig Frasers visuals are fantastic, this movie is gorgeous some of the images deserve their own portrait, it just does the most to tell a story without anyone saying anything.Visual Effects in a much bigger scale and they nailed it, I already loved them in the first, but I don't know how they actually outdid themselves with this one.Dennis Villenueve has written himself in history books with this space epic, this is what it should feel going into the theatre for a blockbuster. Love the choices he made, there's this parallel I noticed and adored, in the beggining of the movie when Paul and his mother arrive in Fremen city they are surrounded by Fremen who hate thee since he killed one of their own, but as he accepts he is Lisan Al-Gaib he's walking through the Fremen who love him and worship him. It was beautiful.The hype is real, go watch this movie, support it, we want more of this, we NEED more of this.",positive
484,"-Visual-
This movie is a feast for the eyes. Denis Villeneuve managed to visualize the planet Arrakis very well (although that's only part of the planet). But, you will be surprised in some parts, because the colors move very quickly, cut to cut, dark to light.-music & scoring-
Well, when Hans Zimmer is in charge, there's no cure, really. The sound design is magnificent. Every time you hear the beat of the music, your chest will shake.-Story-
The storytelling in each act always makes me curious and interested to see the continuation in the next acts. The character development of Paul ""Muad'Dib"" Atreides and his mother is very good. From being a nobody, the community is even skeptical, to being trusted and revered.-Interpretation-
For those of you who study eschatology, understanding this movie will not be difficult. Especially if you learn from several religions. The concepts of messiah, al-mahdi, anti-christ, and prophethood are all here. For myself, I ended up wondering again. About the eschatological concept that I currently believe in. Maybe the promised al-masih & al-mahdi, the concept can match what Frank Herbert wrote (maybe). After all, Frank must also have been inspired by the eschatological concepts of existing religions.",positive

I heard all the reviews about this film and how good it was meant to be but I just couldn't imagine how it could be that good after watching the first film, which I thought was good but nothing outstanding.This film was working on all levels at the highest standard, cinematography, sound design, music, story, costumes, acting and sets! All of it was just incredible and very well executed!I will definitely be seeing this film again at the cinema.

But I still held it when I went into the theater. And I left feeling shocked on how magnificent the film was. You can truly feel the magnitude of power that this film has.

487,"If you're looking for a film that's made of brilliance, that requires persistence and some resilience, that's often quite obscure, and has periods of chore, but is generally engaging, and punctilious. Packed with stars from round the world the cast is great, although old Walken may just get you vexed and grate, as will the nonsense words recited, Florence Pugh don't look delighted, and Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd must have loved to post deflate.

An absolute spectacle which kept my heart beating out of my chest for most of it.Every single aspect of this movie deserves a lot of praise, from the astonishing visuals to the earth-shattering score, but if i have to focus on one thing i would say the performances. Everyone brought everything they had to this movie, this was a labor of love. Zendaya was incredible, balancing out the strength of Chani with the fragility of falling in love with this outsider, Paul and Chani's love was earned throughout the movie, subtly.Timoth√É¬©e was...phenomenal.

489,"Dune: Part Two is the sequel to the sci fi movie Dune by Denis Villeneuve, based on the book of the same title.As an adaption, the movie does a good job delivering the story. It follows the book closely, though there were some differences that will probably be addressed in the third movie.The action scenes, moreover, were spot on, with impressive shots. The movie also doesn't overdo it with its fighting scenes, having them evenly spread throughout the movie and just long enough to not tire the viewer, who would have to sit for a nearly three hour long film.The performances were, in addition, great by everyone in the all start cast.However, there were some things that were lacking. First of all, the romance wasn't convincing, with an odd pacing, and lack of chemistry between the leads.Also, there way the unborn sister was presented was tiring after a while.In addition, the movie seemed to lean more into the cinematography and impressing the audience, then focusing on the storytelling. Hence, for someone who hasn't read the book, the movie will leave them with a lot of plotholes and with one dimentional characters.So, overall, seven out of ten, because it was visually pleasing, but not mesmerizing.",positive

491,"That Sums it up for me... i have not seen a movie yet that did an original book justice let alone surpass my imagination. The creators of theses two movies did just that. They visually and sonically expressed the story better than my mind could while reading it.I understand you cannot put the complete story and world building in just 2,5 hours but. But even so the essence remaines and keeps the story going.Dune elevates the art of book-to-film adaptations, a rare feat in capturing the essence of Frank Herbert's intricate universe. The meticulous craftsmanship extends to the characters, portrayed with depth and nuance. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the grandeur of its political intrigues. Hans Zimmer's score intensifies the emotional resonance, creating an immersive experience. Performances, especially from the stellar cast, bring authenticity to iconic characters.I walked out of the cinema buzzing and wowed 30 minutes ago, still am. That only happened twice before.

493,"Dune Part Two is the sequel to the very successful Dune adaptation. The story picks up right where we left off in the first film. Paul Atreides (Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) unite with the Fremen in their quest to avenge their betrayed family. Paul must prove himself as the so called messiah, the ""Lisan al Gaib"", to unite the different Fremen colonies and overthrow the emperor out of power. He alongside Chani (Zendaya), a fierce warrior and ambitious love interest, will be tested by the brutality of the desert and even more brutal Harkonnens.I'll start by saying this surpasses the first film. The depth and weight of the events that are carried out in this sequel are even more intriguing than the first. The first act mainly gives time for Paul and Chani's relationship development. It follows Paul's trials to becoming Fremen (with a particular scene in mind that I won't spoil for you but it involves a sand worm and is one if not my favorite sequence of the entire film). You are also introduced to new characters like the Emperor played by the legendary Christopher Walken and Princess Irulan played by Florence Pugh, who both are excellent in the film. This is only the first act.The Dune films are brought to life by an ensemble of actors who truly give it their all and portray their characters beautifully. Two performances that stood out for me were Javier Bardem and Austin Butler's ""Stilgar"" and ""Feyd-Rautha"". Props to Javier for including here some awesome comedic timing. His subtle nuances give out these wonderful moments for a good laugh, and it works for me so well because it is unexpected. On the other hand, Austin gives this demonic portrayal which gave me a whole new prospective on his cepabilities as an actor, terrifying but amazing.Each character is further explored and given time to shine. If the first film was more about acknowledging the lore of the Dune universe to the viewers, this film is more about our character's development and arcs.The score of this film somehow got even better than the first one. So much emotion and love was given here. Furthermore, I recently found out the cinematographer who worked on both Dune films is the same one who worked on films which I love like ""The Batman"" and ""The Creator"". Greig Fraser's capture of shots in Dune Part Two will blow your mind. Oscar worthy. The shots that stand out for me are the wide shots. They are glorious. With the mixture of a superb soundtrack by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, the angelic beauty of Greig Fraser's shots and of course the direction of Denis Villeneuve, you are left with a masterpiece.This film is truly a triumph of cinema. In all honesty, I would love for them to make a third film and conclude this into a trilogy but I am also good with them leaving it the way it is. I am fulfilled by the ending and entertained to my core. What an experience, wow.",positive

495,"As a reader and book lover must admit, that this movie is beyond and above. Paul Atreides character breathes and lives on screen thanks to the immense and outstanding talent of Timothee Chalamet - here is all that complexity, entangled revenge, sorrow, doubt, love, betrayal, self sacrifice and ambition, downfall of man and rising of a leader. Chalamet definitely would be remembered as the space prince turned warrior, his path through the desert from youthful man fighting his own gifts to a ruler of the galaxy challenging the great houses and fighting his way to the throne.Apart from the mind blowing acting of the lead characters Villeneuve delivers the most beautiful and breathtaking visuals that contribute to the powerful, heartbreaking, epic deliverance of the story along with the Hans Zimmer masterpiece of a music. Main theme makes you feel the underlying sorrow, the unconditional value of freedom, even above love, the sacrifice ultimate power demands.Dune is not just for sci fi lovers, it is a cinematic experience with layers of messages, it is epic tale for war and love, for great houses and blood lines, an instant classic ..",positive
496,"""Dune Part Two"" is a masterpiece that expands on the epic universe created in the first installment.

It's a must-see for fans of the genre and a testament to Villeneuve's talent as a director.",positive
497,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first part. As a big fan of the books, I thought that they didn't really do enough to build the lore or develop the characters. I thought they concentrated on the wrong elements of the book.I was willing to give the 2nd part a fair chance to correct that. Get things back on track. Its supposed to be an adaptation and part of me does expect the general spirit of the characters to be maintained, even if some of the detail wasnt.Book fans may be disappointed. The writer and director take liberties with the source material, fundamentally changing the nature of a main character. If jars as a book fan to see how they treated Chani. Not only that, but it also makes further Dune movies likely to deviate even further from the source.*spoilers*It was a common complaint that Chani was.little used in the first part of the adaptation. Zendaya appeared fleetingly and had almost no significant input into things. Clearly that's not the case in part 2, but her part in the story is significantly different from the original source.In part 2, Chani seems to switch between loving Paul to telling anybody who'll listen that he's not the messiah and is instead somewhat of a naughty boy. It makes the intimate, romantic stuff seem out of place against her continued effort to undermine the prophecy that he's the voice from another world who'll lead the Fremen to freedom. The 2 sides to Chani really do jar against each other. The romance never feels particularly genuine when she seems to switch from lover to critic in the space of a few minutes of run time.Should that matter? For the movie it possibly doesnt, other than being annoying. But this is the girl who's supposed to be the mother of 3 children to Paul. So to have her storm out of the scene with Princess Irulan and to then end the film with the spurned lover calling a worm to ride alone into the desert has a far bigger negative impact. Book readers know what Chani's role should be. We know what she does in Dune Messiah and how things play out in Children. If there is going to be an adaptation of the 2nd, and maybe even 3rd, books in Herbert's series then Dune part 2 hasn't exactly made it easy to get things back on track. Paul is going to have to do some pretty incredible making up if he;s going to convince the rather detached Chani to be the mother of his kids in time for a potential Messiah adaptation.It's not all bad. The cinematography is great. The sound is fantastic. The scene with Paul addressing the council of naibs is genuinely incredible. His snarling performance in front of his doubters, almost inviting them to challenge him before destroying any of their doubts with his deeply personal knowledge of their history and their ways is one of the finest scenes in recent cinema. Chalamet plays the scene perfectly. Sadly the rest of the movie can't quite reach that high point. The final battlle for Arakeen feels a good few minutes shorter than it should be. The Harkonen character design never feels particularly well done and Beast Raban is more pantomime villain than the guy sent to brutalise the Arakis population.Does any of that matter? If I'd never read the original source material then it probably wouldn't. I'd be a little bit unsure of the character development but I'd probably feel that most of the constituent parts of an epic scifi classic were there. It's a flawed movie, but those flaws probably wouldn't be such an issue as they are for me as a fan of the books.Ultimately the director and writer have told their version of the Dune novel over 2 movies. It's just that the character changes not only fail to help the movie, but they flat out detract from it and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity. It could have been better and it could have set the foundation for a generational series of films.",positive
498,"Dune 2 doesn't just surpass the original in every way it blows pretty much most movies out of the water. The cinematography is mind blowing along with sound design and so much more. Everything about this movie screams polish and passion. Dune is such a complex novel but finally it feels like a worthy adaptation has been crafted with these 2 parts. This is a movie not just for lovers of the book, but also pretty much anyone who appreciates movies period. The cast nails every character with such great accuracy it truly immerses you into the world. Dune 2 is a masterpiece and left me wanting more and also satisfied. Long Live the fighters!",positive
499,"Is it a good movie? Yes
Is it one of the greatest films ever? Nowhere nearFor almost 3 hours i was waiting for that ""One of the greatest movie oat"" part but it never came. Everything feels rushed,like we didnt see half of the things that really happened and the story that they showed us in this 3 hours colud be told in way less time. There were so much unnecessary dialogues and scenes and on top of that it feels like they could add soo much more things that happened to replace those unnecessary scenes. His final test to become their leader or whatever was to catch and ride a worm and they showed us how hard it was for him to catch it but then by the end of the movie we see dozens of people riding it like its nothing and on top of that,one of those people is pregnant women. When it comes to dialogues,just play the scene on 1:46:45 and see for yourselfs. In one shot he is shouting then in next shot he is turned in whole opposite direction and calmly saying ""protect my mother"". That plot twist where he finds out who his grandfather is has been seen dozens of times,soo overused so i find it very uninteresting. And then ending...Damn i expected so much more...He just came there finished his grandfather so easily and then that few minutes fight and thats it...Nothing ""greatest of all time""in there except visuals. It feels like TV show would be much better option then movie.",positive
500,Absolutely no movement and completely boring yawnfest. What's happend to movies of late. Nothing exciting happening and zero excitement or suspense. Actors are 2nd rate and not memorable. What happend to real movies like Die Hard and Mad Max or even Naked Gun or White Chick's? The current state of cinema and movies is pretty bleak as everything seems to feel the need to include a political or current message about society. I think the last movie that actually had some backbone was Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri. That had all the right elements and took on some topics such as revenge and religion.,negative
501,"For a movie that is dangerously close to 3 hours, I am impressed by how quickly it went by. The plot was consistently moving ahead but laced with lovely moments of quiet and stillness. It was visually a masterpiece! Beautiful scenery, detailed costumes, grand scale wide shots and tons of tiny details. In my opinion, the acting and casting were spot on all around. I liked the scenes from the emperor/princess. It was a great way to show those parts of the book.The reason for the missing star (and the spoiler part of my review) is that very jarring, confusing editing choice early on where Paul is sent off on a test mission, but then for some reason Chani is with him all the sudden, and then people ate around. The plot kept going, but the trial never ended?! I thought I fell asleep or blacked out or something. And although I was never bored, in the end it felt both too slow and too fast somehow. But those nit-picky complaints aside, amazing!!",positive
502,"Okay. With every movie I'm hyped to see, I always need at least 2 showings for me to get a proper solid feeling on it. So for the last week I've left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how I feel about this movie. After my first showing, I loved it but I came out with a feeling I wasn't satisfied and it's probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today I have no doubt in my head of how I feel. This movie is perfect.There's genuinely so much I love about this that if I wanted, I could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is. Firstly with the movie itself, the pacing is just godly. How on earth is that an almost 3 hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind. Secondly the sound editing? Unbelievable. The visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from VFX to camera work to cinematography.But finally the acting is where this movie shines. Every actor is honestly carrying this movie and that's what you expect with a stacked cast like this. Timothy is the definition of Paul Atreides. He was born for this role and I pray it's his legacy because he gave it his all and more. The scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes I've ever seen. His acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominated.Zendaya does wonders for Chani especially for me. As a huge Dune series fan, Chani is a good character but she doesn't at all stand out in the books. But when she was announced to be played by Zendaya I knew this would be a twist and man I'm happy with the way Denis took her arc. She's probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how she's not even top 10 in the books. It's crazy how much facial expressions does and Zendaya plays that perfectly. The love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end. I cannot wait to see how Denis uses her in Messiah especially with how she's on a complete different path now.The final actor that really stood out for me is Austin Butler. Doesn't have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and I knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle. He plays this role in such a way it made me care for Feyd-Rautha even though he's a little no villain with little character outside of that. I could go on about every actor because they all do something that makes this movie special but yeah overall just a brilliant cast and a perfect movie.The final thing I have to say is that score that plays from the moment the Emperor kisses the Ducal signet till the end of the movie and the score during the credits, godly level of work from Zimmer he was the best choice for this movie and he delivered beyond perfection for both Parts.",positive
503,"After part 1... a little underwhelmed, with fingers crossed, was hoping for better, always comparing to the original movie from the 80's, and oh my god did it deliver, yes, absolutely, rooted for every minuteImages stuck in my head, almost akin to watching 'A New Hope' when I was kid, I know that is some comparison, but it is truly warrantedThe vastness of the terrain, the beauty of the cast, probably too beautiful, but hey its a film!!Some of the scenes, especially the arena, are just jaw dropping,Truly a film for the generation, never reviewed or even commented ever, but this really is an epic movie, setting a new benchmark!",neutral
504,"I'm now a huge fan. Part 1 was good but a bit too slow but Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet performance was outstanding.Part one gives us a small glance at what's coming and kept us waiting eagerly.I'll try to review avoiding any spoiler.Now onto part 2. It started a bit slow again. Seems like some of the events of the first hour should have been in part one but again we keep learning how Paul gets his legendary status and support.But the second part of the movie is glorious. We have so many great characters and development all over the place. The final battle is exciting, effects are awesome and soundtrack was on track.This is probably the great work of this generation and my kid was excited with the whole story and universe. I wish they would have given us some of the hints of what's coming but I'm happy on how it ended.I'm not loving Zendaya in this film. I feel her acting range is not suited for this one as she's the weaker cast in this film. Everyone else is very involved in their character but she's so plain and linear and doesn't match how great Timoth‚àö¬©e performs here.Can't wait for the next deliveries. I'm definitely going to see this movie several times as we need to support good movies when they appear. 10/10 and fully recommended.",positive
505,"Let me just say this, I watched this with 2 friends. We were having really big hopes and when it's ended, we were like that's it?It is established, that you can't put on film a complex book. On film you have narrow the focus on and dumb it down, especially fi you want it to be successful for the masses. But extraordinary writers and directors manage to do that and with their magical skills to give you a lot more.This is a movie with beautiful scenery, music and sound effects and average anything else.From my perspective, Jessica was made weak for some reason and she supposed to be a perfectly trained Bene Gesserit, when so was throwing up, I was like not ... she has perfect control on her body, she has inhuman reflexes and can even control her body ad microscopic levels not to mention her mind is a fortress.Mentats strategic mind,politics, religion, Arrakis terraforming, Freemen mastering their environment. A strange universe where humans have super specialized abilities that we can only dream of. Is not really present here.And lets get to the actions and fighting, is really a bore. There iare a few basic premises. Fights are with guns, if shield then you move to low speed fighting, lasers rock but shield with lasers =nuke. And we get one scene of attacking a harvester, tens of femens being killed, so they can kill the ornithopter as it had a shield and then they use lasers, logical, but next scenes lasers used with ornithopters flying around, logicless.Next, sword fighting everywhere, like its some fantasy movie. And fremens jumping aroudn like acrobats, killing saurdaukars like they were flies. This was really annoying, fremen are tigh knit community, survivors in a sand world, with really good fighting skills. Sardaukars are product of hell world, were everything tried to kill them since they were babies, trained from infancy to soldiering,tactics and battle. Only the best survive and reach sardaukar elite status. And they have the best equipment. In this movie, they are idiots, running around like headless chickens. Pathetic!And we fast forward to an end, that's truly lame.I can't give less than eight, but that is due the list of utterly devoid of creativity movies we have delivered each year. Just comparing smelling crap Rebel Moon was, this shines like a diamond in the dirt.",positive

I did not want the movie to end!",positive
507,"Undoubtedly this is a beautiful movie. The costumes, the props (eg. The spice gatherers and carriers, the variety & imaginative designs of ships), some of the desert scenes, and a sense of foreboding prevails throughout, as it should - there may be nominations for it. The music is better and less grating than the first movie. The bits they get right, always the ones that are true to Herbert's book are really good, but... When the obviously struggling scriptwriters depart from that, something even non-readers can detect, it becomes unintelligible and a problem for upcoming plot arcs. More on that later. There is a lot of mumbling, a bit of a modern issue. A good actor effortlessly enunciates to avoid this. Florence Pugh is a bit wooden and her role is wasted - rather than laborious and clumsy explanation between characters, in the book Irulan gives a lot of background, as she is the key historic journal (among others), and that's a great device of Herbert's. In this one they change Alia's arc, make Stilgar into some brainless zealot, miss other key characters and Chani's role is a major change issue. The relationship between her and Paul and his visions of her is a key plot mover throughout, yet they've changed her into some #meToo/racial correction statement that will be very problematic, particularly for the next part. It may be the scriptwriters didn't read far enough ahead. I watched this with my partner and he found it increasingly puzzling, it was embarrassing. Weirdly there was a lot of emphasis on 'fundamentalism' which others and I found uncomfortable. The inevitability of Paul's choices was not clear and made him seem petty and vengeful. I think the main issue above all was the lack of relationship establishment - it may have been script issues, actor choice or performance, direction, I'm not sure. Herbert provides some great quotes which they missed out completely and you feel the lack of them - it leaves a hollow where there could be more substance. In fairness, this was a huge undertaking and visually it's stunning, but the relationships that make you care about the characters was a misfire throughout. I would watch it again (with some fast forwarding I suspect) but it could have been a brilliant classic rather than the puzzling and mixed bag it actually was. Dune remains a difficult book to translate to film, sadly.",positive
508,"I just came out of the cinema, and I'm absolutely blown away! ""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterpiece that deserves nothing less than a 10-star rating. It's the best movie I've ever seen! The way Denis Villeneuve has expanded the grandeur of the first film is nothing short of miraculous. The visuals are breathtaking, and the story is richly layered, making it a saga that you feel deep in your bones.Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet as Paul Atreides is phenomenal. He brings such depth to his character, portraying the complex emotions of a young leader caught in a web of love, duty, and destiny. Zendaya's portrayal of Chani is equally mesmerizing, adding a touch of raw human emotion that makes the tale resonate with authenticity.The entire cast, including the talents of Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, contribute to an Arrakis that feels real and alive with political intrigue and social complexity. This isn't just a movie; it's an experience that transcends the screen and stays with you long after the credits roll. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on a cinematic treasure!",positive
509,"Apart from cinematography and set design, the movie is average; only the last half hour is worth it. It's occasionally overly philosophical and slow-paced, reminiscent of Prometheus at times and in atmosphere akin to Blade Runner 2024. Surprisingly, in a world where AI advances rapidly, the special effects here are poorly done. Whether I am too old or if film standards have drastically declined is now a question? Perhaps I expected too much; that sometimes happens with films that carry a certain weight. I would praise Austin Butler, whose acting at times reminds me of a young Christian Bale. ..",negative
510,"I finished watching this movie and I didn't even know what was actually happening most of the time and then I started not even caring about what was happening. I like the Sci-fi genre but this movie was all over the place. It was a slow boring build up about this 'chosen one' being part of a prophecy leading some tribes into a big battle. However, despite the long drawn out build up, the battle itself was over quite quickly. I thought Dune part 1 was good and I was looking forward to part 2, but I was honestly disappointed and got bored quickly. Visually it looks great, no complaints there but the story was just a bit dull and flat in my opinion. I believe this is part of a trilogy and I'm genuinely not even bothered about watching the 3rd installment because I imagine it will be as long and boring as this one.",positive
511,"I was watching it and had the same feeling as when I had reading the book: you feel how some power is growing inside.The reason for it is a shining cast, strong script and spectacular visual effects.Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet performed so well. That was Pole, indeed: with all his kindness, fate and transformations.Florence Pugh. Wow! I hated Irulan from the book. But here: I saw an intelligent, interesting lady.(Here I should say: guilty, I notice these 2 all the time, so in love with ""Little women"")
Rebecca Ferguson finally nailed it. There is no even a sign of this soft and scared Jessica. Jessica from Dune 2 kept me nervous all the time.Chani? Nah. Something is wrong here. Zendaya like came for one more photo shoot.Script. Script! It is strong. Finally, we watch a fantastic movie and every character is well written. Everything has logic (except for Jessica looking extremely happy that the war is approaching).That's not an apple to apple Dune like we've all read. It's better to say: ""based on Dune"". They took the idea and were careful with it. ""Plans in plans"" is not something you can adapt, but I feel that that the writers did their best: I knew what would happen and when, but they managed to get me.Visual part. These epic scenes! ""Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low"".To conclude: I want more! I want this film to become part of my collection! I want to see Anya Taylor-Joy and Jason Momoa too (while I doubt that these 2 will have chemistry, but still).Definitely recommend. That's the fantastic movie we've all been waiting for.",positive
512,"The word that will likely be used most often to describe Dune: Part Two is ""massive"". Expect a whole lot of variations on the words ""epic"" and ""spectacle"" too. Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not approach Frank Herbert's beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations. It's his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to the Oscar-winning 2021 film.While the first installment often felt like half a film, Dune: Part Two locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the old-fashioned storytelling. More than a simple savior or chosen one story, Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.The movie picks up so closely on the heels of the first film that the Fremen are still transporting the body of Jamis (played by Babs Olusanmokun) home after he was bested in the fight with Paul Atreides (portrayed by Timothee Chalamet). After the massacre of House Atreides, Paul chose to go with the Fremen, much to the consternation of his mother Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson). Thinking both Paul and Jessica were taken by the desert and all hopped up on violence after destroying the Atreides interlopers, House Harkonnen amplifies its attack on the Fremen, leading to a few remarkably staged battles between the warriors and soldiers.Villeneuve and his team deftly fill the first hour with battle sequences that counter the firepower of the Harkonnen military and the Fremen tribal combatants, who often literally emerge from the earth to destroy them. Bodies fall from the sky as enormous ships burst into flames in a way that feels nearly operatic. Amidst the chaos, Dave Bautista cannily sketches Rabban Harkonnen as a wartime leader who is in way over his bald head, while Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd leans even harder into a sort of blend between Nosferatu and Jabba the Hutt.As the battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis serves as the backdrop for Dune: Part Two, Paul's arc from nervous young man at the beginning of the first film to potential leader plays out in the foreground. A Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (portrayed by Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul Atreides is the chosen one foretold among his people for generations. Even as so much of the mythology points to Paul's savior role, the Emo King tries to blend into the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani (played by Zendaya). Paul passes the tests put in front of him by the Fremen, takes on the tribal name of Muad'Dib, and vows vengeance against the Harkonnens who were behind his father's death1.Dune: Part Two is not just a sequel; it is a testament to the power of visionary filmmaking. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a work that is epic in scale, yet deeply personal. This film solidifies Dune as a landmark in science fiction cinema, offering a narrative experience that is as intellectually engaging as it is emotionally resonant.As the credits roll, I sit there, spellbound. Dune: Part Two isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It reminds us that power corrupts, that legends are forged in sacrifice, and that love can bloom even in the harshest of landscapes. Villeneuve's direction, combined with breathtaking cinematography and stellar performances, elevates this film beyond mere entertainment.And so, dear reader, I leave you with this: Let the spice flow, let the sandstorms rage, and may your dreams be haunted by sandworms and whispered prophecies.

513,"It's true that the trailer made me hope for a great film, beautiful and spectacular, but I had the impression of watching magnificent shots one after another.It's true that it's beautiful, apart sometimes from the overabundance of special effects which taint the original shots.Unfortunately, I didn't feel any emotion, no suspense, no fear, no sadness, nothing... it's flat.The actors play correctly but nothing sensational either. And apart from the last music of the film, I did not find the soundtrack extraordinary.So I think it must be seen, it remains visually very beautiful, and therefore this film must be seen in the cinema to enjoy it, and if possible in Imax Digital since it was filmed in 70mm.Of course, it's a film that must lose intensity on television and therefore seeing it in the cinema seems essential to me. In my opinion, it will not remain a great film.",positive

But when i saw the trailer for the Part Two and later saw all the clips and reviews for this film, I knew that if I would miss seeing this on a big screen, I could not forgive myself. And I am telling you, do not miss the opportunity to see this. The visuals are stunning, not only Timothe‚àö¬©, but all of the cast are killing it, the music, the story-telling. More you think about this movie, the more complex it gets. The length of the movie is perfect, it does not feel long, on the other hand, you are left craving more.

516,"From the moment the lights dimmed in the IMAX theater, it was clear that Dune Part 2 was going to be an unforgettable cinematic journey. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, this sequel not only continues the epic tale of Paul Atreides and his destiny among the sands of Arrakis but elevates the saga to new heights, both literally and metaphorically, thanks to the immersive IMAX experience.Picking up where the first part left off, Dune Part 2 delves deeper into the complex politics, culture, and the looming war on Arrakis. The narrative expands on the themes of destiny, power, and survival, challenging characters and audiences alike to ponder the costs of leadership and the sacrifices for peace. Villeneuve masterfully balances the dense lore of Frank Herbert's universe with emotionally charged storytelling, making the intricate plot accessible and deeply engaging.",neutral
517,"A friend warned me, that what they did to Chani in pt2 will make me angry. And boy was they right....Why? WHY? Why the need to butcher this great character so much? Would be too politically incorrect, if she kept supporting Paul, be his safe haven amids the Fremen blind devotion and (future) Great Houses scheming? Why made her this... I don't even know what, by the end. And why the last shot of the movie is Zendaya's constipated face (which she sported during most of p2?I actually liked pt 2 better than pt1. Though visually just as stunning, less time was wasted on random slo-mo shots. But thay ending totally ruined it for me. I have no idea how they plan to transision to the next part, wihout adding unnecessary ""Paul chases after Chani because she must get pregnant at some point"" part.WHY???",positive
518,There were so many moments where my friend and I look each other in the eyes on a no homo basis with our mouthed open.Dennis Villeneuve camera usage was phenomenal. The shots were crazy.

I think doesn't need much to convince me. That's probably why my friends can gas light me so easily. Really nothing to complain about.2 hours and 46 minutes is really perfect with a quick break.Really a 10/10 from me.,negative
519,"Don't get me wrong it was breathtaking, always on the edge, great visuals ...But once the dust settled (no pun intended) I also realised this was part of the problem. There was never any break of any kind it was the same thing the whole time. Always dark, always action filled, a tension the whole time. But never really all that interesting either. Intense is the word for it. All the time.Boy and Mother arrive at desert town, mother drinks blue water, boy passes a test and fights, boy goes south after an attack raises an army and destroys emperor army (the bug battles are awful!), wins sword fight against emperors boy, goes after other houses who refuse him as new emperor.The fact he is related to some of the evil guys isn't interesting. I am your father - but boring.That's it... I almost got a bit bored - except that you can't because its always in your face. Weird feeling.And it is in this sense that the children's movie Star Wars IV-VI suddendly appears more superior. Not that they are comparable. One is sort of a feel good family movie the other is this dark piece that is brutal.But what I mean by thaf is that at least there were different plots and sub stories and ultimately you cared about so many characters.Without naming Star Wars charachter names anyone will remember who I mean when I say
two robots,a little green being with magical power,anti-hero smuggler and his alien type bear sidekick,a princess and the princethe evil fatherTry that with Dune and it's just a mush of different people fighting, killing servants, or having loud powerful voices.With Dune there is mostly fighting and not much else. And then shortly after I walked out I realised the only character I care a little bit about - but not that much either - is Chani.I didn't care about anything else. I didn't even know what exactly I should care for in the next episode. Should I really care about whether there will be a paradise or not or who will lead the Fremen to it? Is that the point of it? That's it?The best part about the movie is probably that it has strong female lead characters - or at least they're not second to the men.Again its not a bad movie and I was tending between 6 or 7... more towards 7... but at the time of writing it has 8.8 and that's like ""movie of the decade"" type level... way too high.So I just think it has to come down quite a bit ... so for a fairer evaluation giving it a 6.Sorry fabs.",positive
520,"""Dune: Part Two,"" despite its ambitious attempt to continue the epic saga, falls significantly short of the expectations set by its predecessor, leaving much to be desired in both narrative depth and character development. Where Denis Villeneuve's first installment offered a visually stunning and philosophically rich entrance into the universe of Frank Herbert's iconic series, this sequel struggles to maintain that momentum, veering into the realm of cinematic redundancy and superficial spectacle.The film's pacing is one of its most glaring issues. It oscillates between rushed sequences that skim over crucial plot points and tedious stretches where little of consequence happens. This erratic tempo not only disrupts the narrative flow but also undermines the story's emotional weight, leaving the audience disengaged from what should be high-stakes moments.Character development, or the lack thereof, further detracts from the film's appeal. Newcomers to the cast are introduced with great fanfare but are given scant screen time to evolve beyond one-dimensional figures. This oversight is particularly disappointing given the rich backstories and intricate personalities that define Herbert's characters. Even returning characters, who were previously portrayed with depth and complexity, are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, often acting out of character or being pushed to the sidelines.Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" continues to impress with its breathtaking landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in costume and production design. However, these aesthetic achievements cannot compensate for the film's narrative shortcomings. The reliance on CGI spectacle over substantive storytelling feels like a missed opportunity to explore the novel's themes of power, ecology, and human nature.Moreover, the script seems to struggle with balancing the source material's dense political intrigue with the need for blockbuster action sequences. As a result, much of the film's potential for thoughtful commentary on imperialism and environmentalism is lost in translation, replaced by generic battle scenes that lack the emotional resonance seen in the first film.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a visually captivating but ultimately unsatisfying continuation of the Dune saga. Its failure to capitalize on the groundwork laid by its predecessor results in a sequel that feels both overloaded and superficial. While die-hard fans may find moments to enjoy, those seeking the depth and nuance of the original will likely be left wanting more. This sequel, unfortunately, suggests that in attempting to broaden its appeal, the franchise has sacrificed the very elements that made it distinctive and compelling in the first place.",positive
521,"When I watched the first part some time ago, I wasn't very impressed. The film was very slow and the excitement didn't start until the last 15 minutes. This film, on the other hand, was thrilling from start to finish. There were many memorable moments and the excitement was tense most of the time. The fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitement.Also, I can't say that the film was too abrupt. There was love, depression and compassion very cleverly woven in. The film offered the whole spectrum of emotions.Speaking of the actors, Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet as Paul Atreides did an excellent job, offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power. One could get quite a deep understanding of the phrase 'power corrupts'. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was also excellent. The inner psychological instability reflected in him was extremely convincing.Visually, the film was extremely well made. Combined with the music by Hanz Zimmer, the visuals were so evocative that in some moments I found myself shivering. Definitely a film to experience in the cinema. Excellent.",positive
522,"Experiencing this sequel was a revelation, offering an immersion into a universe that rivals the depth and complexity of the most acclaimed fantasy series. The film's intricate world and narrative grandeur strongly suggest revisiting its predecessor, although its standalone prowess equally engages both longstanding fans and newcomers. Denis Villeneuve's directorial genius shines, making a compelling case for his stewardship over such epic narratives.Surpassing its prequel, the sequel boasts a mesmerizing score by Hans Zimmer, alongside unparalleled technical mastery in visual effects and cinematography, setting new benchmarks. The narrative weaves deeper character arcs while introducing captivating new figures, all amidst jaw-dropping action that leaves a lasting impression.This film not only concludes the journey begun earlier but also skillfully lays the groundwork for future explorations in this saga. Anticipation for its sequel, ""Dune: Messiah,"" is high, with hopes it will further elevate the genre in upcoming awards seasons, challenging prevailing biases against fantasy/sci-fi narratives.An IMAX viewing is recommended to fully appreciate this cinematic masterpiece, poised to become a genre-defining classic.

I'm even satisfied by the changes that they made at the end of the story..
High key, I hope Monsieur Villeneuve did a Director's cut with more graphic scenes. Don't get me wrong it wasn't really missing, but it would of added a layer to it all and would of given more depth to a few characters, yes especially Feyd-Rautha, the brutalist terror wasn't explicit enough for me.Zendaya was brilliant, she truly showed no fear on the screen in a way I rarely seen anyone do it before.But truly while watching it, you just feel how much care everyone who has worked on this movie has giving, flawless.I left the cinema feeling like I just got taught a few lessons and I want to feel and understand more..Can't wait to be blown way by Dune Messiah.Also weirdly enough, it totally damaged the way I thought about Star Wars, like there isn't even a conversation to be had.",neutral

Everything works, amazing story, screenplay, script, cinematography, score, actors, the lot, Denis delivers when so many others have failed. The pace of the film was a major plus factor as well, at no point are we left questioning how we have got there, nothing was rushed unlike many other films that feel the need to overload the audience, which for me ruins a film. The only downside is we have to wait another 3 years for Part 3.",positive

The part that bothered me most is that Chani went into the dessert when kn the book Paul took the princess but, made it clear that Chani was his mate and the he would never give Irulan a child and he would not follow the bene gesseritt's plans to control the bloodlines throughout the ages.",neutral
527,"I loved part one and was really hopeful of a satisfying ending, but was left disappointed.I am a big fan of the book(s) and feel previous attempts at visual interpretations have been underwhelming. The first film changed that. It set the world and characters up thoroughly and steadily. It was long but merited the running time. Part two was a let down.In this film the good work is somewhat wasted. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad film, it just has some problems.Quite long sections were boring. The focus on certain characters and personal issues were given far too much screen time. Zendaya's Chani, I'm sorry but it was like the director was getting a bonus for every second she was on screen. Which might have been fine if the character was not portrayed in such a petulant and petty way. Her huff at the end of the film encapsulated this. Fine to make her role bigger, but it was done poorly.Chalamet's Paul did not develop convincingly, or at all. In the first film he played the character to a tee, but this time the writing left him the childish boy seemingly throughout. His ascendance to the Mahdi/Kwisatz Haderach via the water of life was not given anything like a vision (indeed throughout the film his/his mothers visions and the more mystical parts of the story were left out or completely underplayed). And left you at a loss why he was suddenly behaving so differently.Notable things were left out, in particular the Navigators, but also other elements you would assume would be in here.Too much long stares into the sand, I love the visuals and the whole mythos of this universe, but as a big fan I was sitting there bored several times.Their were some real highlights: Paul's first riding of the worm was really well done. The whole section on Geidi Prime was really great. The fight/battle scenes were done really well also. The senior actors were all fantastic, shame the young leads could not match them.A noble effort with flaws.",positive
528,"What happens when you give an expert filmmaker like Denis Villeneuve a massive movie budget and a massive amount of talent to work with? You get a massive, powerful movie. I left the theater thinking, ""I just saw the movie of the year.""I was aware of the hype going in, but did not expect to personally give Dune: Part 2 a 10/10, but it reminded me of the full potential of cinema. There are many movies that entertain me, but this one was more than simple entertainment... it was an experience. It's not often a movie gives me goosebumps, and I got them multiple times throughout this movie.I thought to myself while watching, ""This is what top-notch movie making looks like."" I also thought, ""This has got to be the most expensive movie ever made."" It's visually out of this world. In a time where streaming movies at home is the most popular way to see a movie, Dune: Part 2 is another reminder of just how special seeing a movie in theater can be. The cinematography and sound alone make this a movie that must be seen in the biggest theater possible.It's hard to believe without seeing it, but Dune: Part 2 will be counted among the best sequels ever made, best sci-fi films ever made, best literature adaptations ever made, and perhaps best films overall ever made.",positive
529,"He loves setting the mood, and oh lord, he does it well. But he does it too much.This movie, just like the others he directed, needs a bunch of cuts....
Paul keeps looking at Chani over and over again. We understand, we don't need you to remind us seven times in the scene.A lot of scenes are too exhausted, too long. I'd remove maybe more than 30 minutes of excessive and repetitive ""mood setting scenes"". Seriously, great music, powerful visuals, awesome designs... But please, Denis, stop making your films longer than needed. People complained about seeing Frodo's face over and over again... This guy does the same until we just want to punch our eyes...",positive
530,"The effects and cinematography was amazing. It was visually flawless. The sandworm attacking at the climax was absolutely amazing.The story had much to be desired. I kept waiting to be moved by the storyline, but it never happened. There just wasn't anything to connect me to the main characters. Dune 1 we were connected by the lose of his father and his people. We wanted to see Paul get his revenge, but somehow that got lost and didn't translate to Dune two.The time line jumps around and too often I was wondering how we got to one moment from the next.The dialog was hard to follow and I wasn't sure what was the motive of Paul most of the time.The end when we were supposed to be satisfied by Paul and the fremens victory just seemed to miss the mark. Most memorable franchises move you emotionally and you are along for the ride, but not this movie.",positive
531,I read the book over 40 years ago. I saw the David Lynch version and the crappy TV versions - guess what - they are better this this rubbish!Plot holes are deeper than Dunes. This whole saga didn't need 2 movies - Lynch did a great job with tech of the day. How many scenes of empty sand do we need to see before we realise that we are being ripped offf big time?Abosute crap - why on Dune's Earth did Chiani have a NYC accent when Stilgar was an Arab?Chiani never did what she did at the end of the book and she was never portrayed as an activist . Where was Alia? Oh Dear - ooops! Pathetic movie.,positive
532,I love it. They made it better then first one. Sounds and effects were perfect I watched at Imax and I felt it. Actors were good they played well. The movie near perfect. The end can't be my favorite scene but It was fine. I beleive paul muadib usul what a great history and story he was badass. This is all my ideas for this film. You don't need to read after this.The first thing you should know about the movie was the story behind it all in this video is the movie where you get a sense that it was created to help the movie to make it look better and more like it is the story of a true hero in a different world.,positive
533,"This movie was particularly gorgeous and exciting giving all the key moments and suspense that anybody of the sort would love, this movie brings the suspense and excitement to keep you engaged and always cautious of what's next, a truly wonderful story that is acted so perfectly and well, this adaptation has brung the story alive and in the spotlight proving there is not only a lot to it but also that it has a lot more to come and personally I want to see it all. I left the theater thoroughly wanting even more for the story and continuing on that I can't wait for what is to come of this movie. It is truly a must watch masterpiece.",positive
534,This whole film was amazing. The game time was perfect. The fights was good. The last fight between the two chosen one is insane. I never rate any film ever but this film is deserving a good rate. Can't wait to see the next episode. The characters build up was also good. The effects wqs incredible too. Every film should be like similar to this in the story line and the whole concept. This is not that slow like the first episode. The actors acting was incredible aswell. After the half game time of the film you can't really saw the next move in the film. It was mysterious even the ending was mysterious.,positive
535,"Denis Villeneuve delivers nothing short of a monumental achievement in science-fiction filmmaking, and the best adaption of Frank Herbert's Dune up to date. The world is captivating, the visual effects and the production design are flawless. Greig Fraser's breath taking Cinematography, accompanied by Zimmer's sumptuous musical score bring you into the story of the madness of conquest and the power of belief.Filled with breathtaking images, stunning action, it's a story that transcends it's genre. A story that is dense as the world of Dune remains intriguingly complex, full of characters whose roles shift and evolve. And even if it may take five and a half hours for his character to truly come to life, two films in, Chalamet's evolution as Paul gives everything a center. His subdued yet compelling performance serves the thematic ambiguity of Paul's character well. Zendaya gets more screen time then in the first film, but for me the standout performance came from Rebecca Ferguson. During this film I truly understood why she was best cast for this role. Javier Bardem further enriches the ensemble cast.The best new addition to the crew is Austin Butler as the baron's bald-pated, hyper vicious nephew. As for Florence Pugh, even if her character is only getting a certain amount of screen time amidst Dune: Part Two's cast of returning characters, her impact could not be seen as minimal, setting the scene for further character development. Other newer characters like Lady Margot remain a bit more unexplored.In our age of ever-increasing runtimes, it's a rare achievement that the film's 166-minute length feels really earned. But I do wish it had even more EVEN MORE run time, to allow more time for the most uncomfortable emotions to linger on in some scenes.Ultimately, Dune: Part Two is a grand entertainment that also sustains the main ideas of Frank Herbert's novel, exploring the dark aspects around religion, politics, power and violence. Absolute sensory overload. This must be seen on the biggest screen possible, with IMAX being almost like a chief's kiss. If Dune: Part 1 didn't make you a believer; Part 2 just might.Cannot wait for Dune Messiah for us to have the complete trilogy, in the vison of the masterful director Denis Villeneuve.",positive
536,"Just saw this in IMAX. Wow, what a well done movie, a terrific rendition of the second half of the book ""Dune"".In many ways, the movie is an improvement on the book, making Chani's character a more realistic version of the tough fighter that she was instead of the pliable obedient 1960s era woman in the book. None of that ""history will remember us as wives"" ending.The progression of Paul's gradual acceptance of the mantle of the Lisan al-Gaib is also fleshed out better.Austin Butler stands out in his role as the psychotic Feyd Rautha. The portrayal of the world of Giedi Prime in black and white was terrific.The sandworms and the sand trout and their connection to the Water of Life were all well done.Some have criticized Stilgar's transformation from a tough tribal leader into a True Believer, but that was his character arc in the book. Javier Bardem showed this progression well.The Great Houses refusing to accept Paul's rule at the end, thus triggering a devastating holy war, was another logical change from the book. I had always wondered why the jihad in the book still started when the Great Houses had accepted Paul as Emperor already.A great movie, destined to be remembered as one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.",positive
537,"Bold statement incoming: the combination of 'Dune Part One' and 'Dune Part Two' has officially become my favorite film adaptation of a book. The profound impact of Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science fiction masterpiece on both literature and religion is not to be overshadowed by Denis Villeneuve's visionary homage. This is the book come to life, and if you appreciate the book, the movie should resonate deeply with you.I struggle to think of a better-executed sequel; though 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight' are certainly in the running, 'Dune Part Two' excels beyond both. Its strength lies in the combination of jaw-dropping world-building, extraordinary acting, and a script that allows the audio-visual experience to unfold effortlessly. 'Dune' is a spiritual journey deeply rooted in Muslim culture and Western Colonialism's quest for natural resources, which is even more relevant today as it was nearly 50 years ago when the book was written (i.e., ""The Spice,"" which always equated to oil in my mind).Aesthetically, the film has no equal, which is no surprise considering the director's extraordinary track record, including 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Arrival', and 'Sicario', all of which are in my Top 50 films of all time and deserving of a perfect 10/10, along with 'Dune Part One'. 'Dune Part Two' exceeds its predecessor in every way, elevating the story in such climactic fashion that my heart and mind were positively buzzing for a solid 90 minutes. It has no weak link, no tonal inconsistency, and no extended dip in energy or over-explanation in which to lose the viewer. It is a perfect film from my perspective and likely to crack my top 5 all-time (I will reserve final judgment until I can see it in 70mm IMAX next week).",positive
538,"I'd like to start my review by saying I'm not a Sci Fi fan, I don't ""get"" the genre. But this... Well, this (Dune 1 and 2) completely and utterly shattered that notion.The cinematography, visuals, soundscapes and music are just so incredible, so far ahead of its time, so magnificent - my brain literally couldn't cope.I'm actually grateful that dialogue was kept to a minimum because there is just so much to take in and absorb, that dealing with bloated dialogue would have ruined it completely for me.Instead this film relies on iconic scenes, memorable, heart wrenching sounds, majestic visuals (that leave your jaw dropping) and landscapes that have you thinking ""this cant be real""I watched it on IMAX but am going back a 2nd time to watch on normal screen in the cinema and have already pre-ordered on Apple TV. Because this was, for me, a once in a lifetime cinematic experience.",neutral
539,"I was really looking forward to Dune Part 2 in the hope that it would be better than Part One. Don't get me wrong P1 was a decent effort and set the scene reasonably well for the second instalment. Sadly, I was disappointed.Much of the criticism of the original Lynch movie stemmed from the fact that Lynch altered a few of the key aspects of the novel but the same can be said of Villeneuve's production too. I'd argue Lynch's changes are far less problematic. At least he kept Alia and the Guild Navigators and didn't consign them to footnotes. What the hell is Spaihts and Villeneuve talking about when they say the passion for Leto's death in P1 would be diminished with a time jump of a few years to P2 just so they could avoid casting a child actor in the role of Pauls sister? It makes no sense and diminishes P2 immensely.On the Guild Navigator's not appearing in the original novel; well the whole point of introducing them in the Lynch movie and the TV shows was to emphasise who had the real power in the Universe and who it was that Paul had to defeat to become the God Emperor. By leaving them out it needs some other vehicle to persuade the audience of the jeopardy faced by the Atreides dynasty and their Fremen followers. This production fails on that score.My main problem with P2, however, is the whole alteration of the time from the start of P1 to the end of P2. In the novel and the Lynch movie there was no such problem. By cramming so much into such a short period of less than a year, rather than the 2 years of the book, the whole feeling of the film becomes messy and disjointed. Maybe, it was due to the budget constraints. $190m is not a lot for a movie these days. Lynch's movie cost $40m over 40 years ago. Today, we would expect at least $250m if not $400m for such a prestigious movie, with so much expectation. Far greater than in 1984.Both P1 & P2 have been hyped up a great deal and rightly so. Audiences ought to expect a genuine epic from such great source material and with a strong history of visual productions. However, the end result was a space drama with no drama, a lack lustre soundtrack, mediocre acting, a lame script and a messy screenplay. I don't even think the costumes were all that good. No style. No panache. No drama. No humour. No intrigue.Chalamet ought to have been able to mature in his role but he wasn't given the chance. I'm not entirely convinced he could have pulled it off anyway. He looks like a young skinny teen at the end of P2 just as he did at the start of P1. The same cannot be said of Kyle MacLachlan, whose Paul Muad'dib Atreides would have had millions of Fremen warriors chasing after him across the galaxy. I couldn't see the Fremen following Chalamet into battle on Arrakis, let alone on a crusade to decimate the universe. Let's not even mention the missing characters in P2 or the unsatisfactory relationship of Paul and Chani. I never felt warm to any of the characters, which I did in both the 1984 original and the TV shows.Every omission and alteration creates problems that go beyond the basic story. It made the movie feel more like a first draft rather than the finished article. God knows how much was left on the cutting room floor but if what we ended up with is the best the editor could give us then he either deserves an Oscar or never to be hired again.No Thufir Hawat. No Count Fenring. No Guild Navigators. No child Alia. No Leto Atreides II. No Harah. There is a reason these characters exist in the novel and why leaving them out makes for a far less satisfying evening at the theatre. Will there be a Part 3? Villeneuve says it makes sense but if he's going to butcher Dune Messiah as much as he did with Dune then I'm not sure anyone should give him the budget.I gave Part One, 8/10. I give Part Two, 6/10, simply because it is worse than P1 when it should have been better.",positive
540,"Once again all hail to Dennis Villeneuve. Man made a movie that even better than the first part. The wait is worth for it. The screenplay, cinematography, visual effects everything at top notch. The worm shots everything at its finest. The way first half nobody would expect this much turnaround in the second half.Oooh man hans Zimmer this guy always came up with something new. In the second half the sound track lite it up the theater. I was watching an awe. In my life i always looked out these guys. Can't wait for the third part. I know thats gonna be a story of the tragedy. Also the can't forget the performance of zendaya, tim and austin butler.",neutral
541,"Dune Part One ranks in my top 10 of all time, so my anticipation for this film was sky-high.The positives: The movie showcases incredible creativity and breathtaking visuals. The costume design is particularly striking, and the ensemble cast delivers standout performances across the board.However, there are some drawbacks: Around the midway point, something felt off. Rebecca Ferguson and Timothy Chalamet's characters seemed to undergo a sudden transformation, almost as if they forgot who they were. While character development is expected, this shift felt jarring and poorly explained. The pacing also felt inconsistent, with moments dragging while others rushed by. This reminded me of the character arc of Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, where her evolution felt sudden and unearned. Additionally, the desert setting dominates the film, creating a feeling of monotony throughout. What made Part One special seems lacking in Part Two; there's a sense of missing that extra touch or uniqueness.",positive
542,"It's a shame because the first movie was more accurate and loyal to the book (except the Hakonnen being bald) but in this movie they went fine for the first 1.5 hours and then it's a free fall.The ending was really disappointing and not even close to the book. Where was princess Alia? A really important character that was left out. How long can Jessica be pregnant? It's ridiculous.Maybe they should have made another movie and give more attention to the final battle.People who didn't read the book or saw the first movie from 1984 don't know that the plot is different and perhaps that's why they think it's a masterpiece. Well, it's not.",negative
543,"One of the finest movies out there, perfect in every aspect from my perspective. The actors deliver an exceptional performance, the story is compelling, and the visuals and sound are truly extraordinary. Witnessing such remarkable performances from everyone involved, coupled with the director's skill and precision, sets a standard for others in the film industry on how to create an outstanding masterpiece. In the midst of numerous disappointing movies during the pandemic and in general, this feels like an oasis in the desert. Great job to all involved.Exceptional movie, a beacon in the film industry. Applause to the entire team!",positive
544,"Music, cinematography, acting, cast EVERYTHING is absolutely amazing. One if not the best movies I have ever watched. I just can't wait for the next part that im sure will be as good as this one if not even better. I loved Timoth√©es performance it's one of his better. In fact whole cast did such a good job and i loved each one of the performances. Hans Zimmer also made a masterpiece. I couldn't image someone else making music for this movie. Every minute of this movie was keeping me in tension. Also the cinematography of this film is beautiful. If you haven't watched the movie yet you need to go see it.",positive
545,"This is not your typical blockbuster vibe. It's not a simple remake of old movies or lets says a marvel movie. Not that dont like those kind of movies. But in my way i always classifying movie in the different familly. One for the movie that are for fun that distract me. Marvel MCU did great for that. Here Denis Villeneuve put his dream into screen to share is fabulous interpratation of the book. The story, the costume, the soundtrack, the actors, the colors and the picture are all epic. I love Kubric movie for the same kind of reason. I'm glad the the box office relate to that. I think i will reread the books before third part.",positive
546,"This is the best movie i watched in the past 10 years, maybe one of the best in my life, Just pure cinema, not a flick like much others we have been swamped with lately, simply it's perfect from story to special effects to acting every moment of it is something you will enjoy watching and will remember for long time as something you miss in all movies we watch lately
Hope this helps in correcting the direction our movies have been taking lately and put things back on the right track
I never read the books but after watching this movie will start on it soon
and can't wait to see the 3rd chapter of this masterpiece.",positive
547,"Dune Part Two is one of the best movies of this generation and that might even be an understatement. It is a practically flawless movie with many aspects that just transcend our current expectations for filmmaking and sets a new standard of excellence.The visuals for this movie are so breathtaking it seems almost a disservice to try and put it into words. Intoxicating. Galvanizing. Hair-raising. Heart-stopping. Awe-inspiring. Spine-tingling. Soul-stirring. These words alone couldn't describe the transcendence and otherworldly feeling you get experiencing this movie on the big screen on IMAX so do yourself a favor and book that ticket NOW.Hans Zimmer completely outdoes himself again with a captivating score that somehow not only rivals but surpasses his previous Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score from Dune Part One.Timothee Chalamet is an absolute star. His progression and development as Paul Atreides is so raw and captivating and I believe it's completely within reason to say that this movie cemented his status as one of the best actors of this next generation. Speaking of the best actors of this generation, Austin Butler was also a standout for his portrayal as the extremely menacing Feyd-Rautha. Notable performances also include the incredible Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem.Overall, this is simply an unforgettable experience and masterpiece of a movie that demands immediate indulgence. It was a visual feast that you will walk away from still digesting what in the world you just watched. You will be leaving full to your stomach and yet hungry enough to go back for seconds. And thirds. And fourths....You might think people are over exaggerating and Dune 2 much... they're not. Go watch it. It's that good.",positive
548,"Just great. Impressive pictures, great costumes. Finally serious sci-fi again! No stupid jokes, no black and white plot so simple you want to scream. The characters are complex and the protagonists are not just good, they don't have a clean slate. Everyone has his own agenda.A few things have been changed from the book, but subtly and, in my opinion, for the better! The role of the female characters, and especially the Bene Gesserit, has been significantly enhanced. That fits well into the story. In the books they were too passive, too small for me. The Bene Gesserit are incredibly powerful, and it makes sense to put this in the foreground. Jessica and Chani also have significantly more personality, act more independently and have their own ideas.The ending is not a sweet Hollywood-typical everything will be fine now ending. There will be at least one more sequel. The material will not be easy to implement on film if you know the books and the rest of the story. But so far, Villeneuve made an outstanding job!",positive
549,"Dune is a very hard book to capture on the screen, so this was a monumental accomplishment.The movie captures the atmosphere of the universe very well and is cinematographically very nice. The movie stays pretty true to the book; I read the book when I was 14 years of age. To be honest, most of the movie is how I more-or-less imagined things to look like in my mind.The dialogue on this movie is a little dry. Not everything is thoroughly explained which the books probably do a better job of. Some characters could have used more development but I don't remember if that's an issue with the source material.This movie follows the general recent trend of improving movie quality in cinema, after about a decade or so of Marvel dominance. It is unique, artistic, and detailed, and tackles a large scale project.",neutral
550,"This movie felt like a load of guilty pleasure, I enjoyed it and had fun. But most great things about the movie are credited to the book aka the plot, lore, setting, characters, politics etc. The ""filmmaking"" part of it beside Cinematography was mediocre to good at best. The emotion range and Believability of characters for example, every single character had one single role in this movie, no depth, complexity or character development. The dramatic scenes were extremely bad, why would shani look at the screen giving her back to the enemies during a WAR!!Disappointed, but still enjoyed it.....",positive
551,I love this sci-fi drama. So good. The cinematography and soundtrack are outstanding! I love how the music feels like its own character. The acting is beyond phenomenal! A must see for 2024! I have seen it twice and ready to go again!Timothee Chalamet is the new Johnny Depp of his generation and commands the screen.The story is immersive and I never wanted it to end. I left wanting more. I recommend you watch Part 1 of Dune before going to see Part 2. It will not disappoint and you'll be glad you did. Stars wars for grown-ups.I am ready for Messiah now! Come up green light Part 3 for us!!,positive
552,"I had not read any of the Dune books so the only guide I had to the story and characters was the first film. I thought Dune was OK-ish but nothing special, it didn't grab me at all. I hadn't intended to see
Dune II but did so after reading the many good reviews. I'm afraid my take on this one was pretty much the same as that on the first. At times it looked like whole scenes had been missed out, as though they were being saved for an extended-edition DVD, and so it was very difficult for me to follow the story as there seemed to be no continuity and no rationale for what was actually taking place on screen. Will I be going to see Dune III, as inevitably there will be one, probably not. Rated 6 purely for the special effects.",positive
553,"Very bad acting by Timothee and Zendaya , literally worst actors ever. The dialogue is sophomorish and low IQ. The plot is predictable. The script is just lame boring and crap..The acting is woody .. the costumes don't even look better than the costumes in the original 1980s Dune movie. The original Dune movie is 10x better than this overrated movie. This movie has so many flat boring scenes..if not for the over dramatic sound and sound effects I would have fallen asleep already. Did I say the acting is really bad? Seriously the original Dune movie is 10x better and more original. The characters in these new Dune movies are just so shallow.",negative
554,"One of those rare movies that takes you into the world it portrays...Absolutly amazing cast, effects, storytelling and pace..I hear alot of ""critic"" that its really slow in 1st 70% of movie, and thats a lie, movie starts real fast and never looms back. Personaly, Ausitn Butler stole the show, but in movie this good, its so hard just to take one component. I knew the story, I red the book, I seen the old Lync movie, and still this one went over all my expectations..Denis, thank you for this amazing work, this is true labor of love! This is how you do justice to source material! Now long wait for 3rd one!",positive
555,"There really isn't a movie to compare this to. It is so insanely well done. Absolutely lives up to all the hype. You can tell that this movie was made by people who care about what they are delivering to the audience. They didn't cut corners, and they delivered a masterpiece! They do an amazing job of immersing you in the world and you deal fully invested in the story. I cannot think of one way the movie could have been improved. The only complaint I have is that I was left wanting MORE. I cannot wait for Dune: Messiah to see how the story continues. I guess I will just have to read the books in the mean time.",positive
556,"Truly a must watch. Best cinematic experience ever. And I am old...from sound, cast performances, sets...hats off!!! Still under impression...I was taken aback already by part one, but this one was stronger. From the first second I was glued to the seat. Do not know how I am gonna wait until the part three. I guess I need to go watch it again. Every impresiion of the movie is very strongly given to the audience. Even my wife was taken aback by the movie and the Dune is not really her genre. So hats off to everbody and just can't wait for part three. A masterpiece, no doubt about it. Thanks to all that were involved.",positive
557,"I am a fan of the books, I highly rated the first film and this sequel is just as good if not better.I don't much rate Timothy Chalamet as an actor and thought he was cast wrongly as Paul but I thought his performance was better in this film than the first.Zendaya also gave an improved performance as Chani after her character was given more development, giving her meatier material to work with this time around.Rebecca Ferguson and Stellan were both decent, following up from their performances in the first film.Austin Butler gave a good performance as Feyd- Rautha, he pulls the psychopathy of Feyd off well and doesn't camp it up like sting did.The film follows the second book faithfully and let's the storyline unfold without rushing things along. The cinematography is gorgeous to look at, made for the big screen and the costumes are stunning. Props to Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack too.",positive
558,"Soooo epic. Religion, Love, Drama and war. Everything ist in it and on an epic scale. The pictures are stunning and the music breathtaking. Ist futuristic and on the other Hand also very basic and the Story itself could also play in the middle age. The Main Thema are timeless and very interesting. The Characters and the the Artists playing Them are amazing and very Deep. Ist mystic and from an other world but yet it picks up themes we know all to well from our everyday life. Watched it in IMAX and it was the best Cinema experience in a Long Long Times. It for sure is a 5/7 and i would recommend it to everyone.",positive
559,"Dune: Part Two is one of the few movies that have ranked so high in a long time, as well as one of the best Science Fiction Movies Ever Made.This movie takes us deeper into Arrakis, where after the murderous fall of House of Atreides led by the forces of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) commanded by Lord Rabban (Dave Bautista) as seen in the first Dune Movie. In this second part, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), exposed by the Harkonnen after devastatingly losing their family... join forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, the local people of Arrakis long before The Harkonnen first arrived. Paul sets on a Journey to learn the ways of the desert, while Lord Rabban has full authoritarian control of Arrakis to boost the production of spice to its full capacity in order to gain full control of the planet. After Paul passes the most important lesson in the Fremen Training taught by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), he ascends Paul, and becomes Lisan Al-Gaib, the leader of their people with the duty of proving that he is the Fremen's last hope of taking back Arrakis and freeing the Fremen from battling with the Harkonnen. Paul learns that his power to predict the future has grown stronger. Lady Jessica after becoming the Reverend Mother of the Fremen, gets pregnant of a baby girl, to be Paul's Younger Sister. But it's not too long before Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) returns making a failed attempt to ambushing the Harkonnen in order to make them more vulnerable, Gurney makes his way towards the Fremen Camp, where he reunites with recently ascended Paul and Lady Jessica. As things happen in Arrakis, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen requesta his psychotic nephew, Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) to join him on their same mission: Joining him and Lord Rabban to take Arrakis as their own, control it and then kill the last three known members of House of Atreides along with the Fremen once and for all in order to dominate Arrakis with the full production of spice by their side. As The Fremen plan their strategy to ambush the Harkonnen, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his Daughter, the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) learn that Paul Atreides is alive after suppossing that the attempt to murdering Paul, Lord Rabban succeeded in taking him out along with every single member of the House of Atreides during the House's fall. The Emperor, Princess Irulan along with their fleet, make their way to Arrakis in order to take out Paul Atreides and boost the production of spice to gain control. But then, the Fremen, along with Paul and Gurney's help, roll the dice and take on the Emperor and the Harkonnen, after The Emperor was found responsible for the death of Duke Leto Atreides, he finds himself exposed and recently made more vulnerable. The Fremen; recently successful in the battle for their freedom against the Harkonnen, cheer up. Paul finds himself hungry for revenge against the Emperor but instead, has a deadly combat with Feyd-Rautha in which Paul eventually succeeds. Following his success, he is assigned to The Emperor's Throne, but since Paul wanted more, he doesn't express interest in sitting on it. He wanted power, freedom and mostly, avenge the death of his father and the fall of the House of Atreides. Princess Irulan begs Paul to spare his father's life in exchange of assigning herself to be Paul's wife. Action that leads to Paul's ultimate betrayal against Chani, which devastates her and leads her to leaving the Fremen Alliance. Paul, after seeing her walk away disappointed by this so-called betrayal act, Paul says absolutely nothing, then decides to make The Grand Move: Attack all the Great Houses after the exposure of The Emperor and the loss of his power, which we'll see in Dune: Part Three.",positive
560,"There's nothing wrong with gratuitous cinematography, it was beautifully done, but I felt like it was visuals at the expense of storytelling. There are a lot of nuances in Dune that could have been brought out in the film if they had paced a little bit better. WHERE WAS ALIA? The way the screenplay was written, the expected you to believe that Paul had his meteoric rise to Messiah and they were somehow able to put a huge dent in spice production all in about 6-7 months? In the bookand in all other adaptations, it was clear that this happened over a long period of time. Maybe 3 -4 years, which made more sense. Missing that scene of a freakishly wise toddler stabbing her evil, fat grandfather in the neck really dampened my experience. #JusticeforStAliaoftheKnife.",neutral
561,"I'm not one for writing reviews but BOY OH BOY! You will need to see this in cinemas for the ultimate experience. I just saw it in Dolby and I couldn't contain my excitement. I loved every scene! Hell even the Villians were TOP TIER. I was happy to see this and will be a long time fan coming. Also hats off to Hans Zimmer, He's done it again with a beautiful soundtrack.

I really enjoyed myself and hope that the third installment will leave me feeling the same as this one did..",positive
562,"I'm not sure this is a masterpiece or a game changer. This movie seems trapped in its own style; it doesn't have the loose, inhabitable vibe Star Wars has (sorry to use this as a reference). It might not be its setup, but it feels rigid.Take Giedi Prime, for instance, which seems like an action movie shot in a modern art museum, with (maybe) cool-looking but silly design choices like a black sun. Then there is an issue with the pacing. There's lots of build-up but an unsatisfying wrap-up with the Sardaukar. The way emotions are evoked, like the way Javier Bardem's character is meant to do at times, feels forced.Some originally bad-ass characters have poor resolutions, and the action doesn't have the punch you'd expect it to have. Some scenes look absolutely spectacular, but overall, it's style over substance, just not that engaging.",negative
563,"Meaningless talks ,talks and again meaningless talks. So boring.Did i mentioned meaningless talks. Yes indeed so boring.It is impossible to watch without sleeping.Also costumes and enviorement are so boring. Desert, desert and again desert.You have to be so patiret to watch.Characters are so plain. Nothing to wonder about it.Music so boring also. Nothing good about this film . Nothing good indeed. How people give 5 star is not understable. I will repeat what i said in the firs place. The movie is so noring and boring and boring. Do not waste your time watching this film. Go and watch any another movie. Thats all.",positive
564,"Denis Villeneuve has managed something that is very rare : a sequel that is better than the original movie.Dune: Part Two joins The Empire Strikes Back and the Godfather in that rare list.The way Arrakis is brought to live on the screen (and Giedi Prime...OMG) is simply magical, and the sheer scale of the project results in in not just a big blockbuster but a piece of art.There is not one moment that the movie doesn't ring through, and the performances, the visuals, the sound, the music and the effects all come together very organically.Denis Villeneuve has now made 3 or 4 Sci-Fi masterpieces in a row (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049 and Dune I and II). Looking forward to seeing what else this magician can pull out of his hat next time.",neutral
565,"Dune, part 2 stands as a visually stunning sequel that adeptly continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert's timeless sci-fi masterpiece. Led by the talented Timoth√©e Chalamet, the cast delivers captivating performances, with Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides particularly mesmerizing as he navigates the complexities of his destiny. The film's breathtaking visuals, intricate production design, and seamless special effects immerse viewers in the vast and unforgiving landscape of Arrakis.Beyond its visual spectacle, Dune, part 2 delves deep into rich thematic layers, exploring the intricate interplay of politics, religion, ecology, and identity within a sprawling galactic conflict. Each scene is laden with symbolism, inviting audiences to ponder the broader implications of the narrative's themes.Moreover, the film is a thrilling adventure from start to finish, punctuated by epic battles, suspenseful sequences, and poignant moments that resonate with emotion. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully crafts tension and excitement, ensuring that audiences remain engaged and invested throughout the journey.As the second installment in a planned trilogy, Dune, part 2 successfully builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, offering a satisfying continuation of the epic saga. Its meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to Herbert's vision make it a must-watch for both fans of the genre and admirers of visionary filmmaking.",neutral
566,"This movie is simply a masterpiece. It will be a pillar of science fiction genre. Hat off to Denis, as he is one of the best directors of his generation. It still amazes me how this man can't do an average movie. He understands how movies works, he puts the accents on character development, story, visuals, sound, to deliver us immersive experiences like no others. Everything works perfectly in this movie. I just didn't want it to end. It shoks me to see people rating movies 1/10 just because Zendaya was in it, or because it's too long, or because they didn't like the music (it just goes to show how little some people understand movies and the effort put by the creators to offer the best cinematic experience possible. As a fun fact, no director or producer starts off by wanting to do a bad movie. Even the most mediocre movies I can't rate them with less than 5 or 4 stars, let alone give it a 1 star because I didn't like one thing, completely ignoring the other things that make it great). Writing this I feel the need to go see it one more time :) Good day my fellow movie lovers.",positive

568,"They did an amazing job with cinematography and the world building, and the character development. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and this one here is damn near perfect.the pacing is good, a little better then the first one. It's a must see in theaters for the experience. So excited to see where they take the movie next. I loved that they started the movie right off where they left it at, and the surprises of certain characters, and how certain character arch's are played out in this movie was handled greatly. You can really tell that they were set out to make a masterpiece and not another cookie cutter movie filled with familiar tropes like what they end up doing to Star Wars. 10/10 for me. Great job!!",positive
569,"FUNNY COMMENT: A giant cult follows a brave teenage boy with mommy issues, who suffered the death of his father, gets visions in his sleep, is constantly on red drugs that make him halucinate, and drank poison from worms that make him halucinate even more!SHORT REVIEW: All jokes aside, this movie was spectacular. With amazing storytelling and music that immerses you in this sci-fi, fantazy world. The most beautiful scenery and images in every scene. And acting that just can't be complained about. But the story suffers from poor character writing in some parts.SOUNDS AND SOUNDTRACK: I saw the movie in the cinema with Dolby Surroundsound and it was one of the greatest experiences with sound i have had. Hans Zimmer made a track that is unique and fitting the genre of sci-fi, and the setting. I will definitely check out the soundtrack later.STORY AND STORYTELLING: The story fit in extremely well with its precursor and very few if any bad kliches. It was thought out, thought provoking, and emotionally provoking. There was very little i thought could have been done differently: Paul's sudden change of heart regarding being leader, felt dissatisfying as he had no inner conflict with his choices or embarassment towards Chani. The death of Rabban i thought was too fast, being done in only 3 or 4 moves, with little to no emotional satisfaction. The twist of the baron being his grandfather felt a little unasked for. But if it plays a bigger role in the third installment, it won't be a problem. And lastly the death of Feyd Rautha. I enjoyed Austin Butlers character enormesly and didnt like seeing him die. But also think that his death was very well writin and epic. I no longer see Austin Butler for his role as Elvis.THE PACING: It felt very thought through and worked well on the big screen. It really gave way for us to enjoy the stunning images, without feeling forced. Though i wanted more of Paul and Chani's chemistry, and a scene with Paul telling her about his visions of her. I think that would have shown their tight bond, and make the ending even more heart crushing.FINAL RATING: 9,3

570,"I find myself perplexed by the casting choices in this film, particularly the inclusion of Christoffer Walken and Anna Taylor-Joy, among others. Their presence in the movie felt incongruous to me and significantly impacted my viewing experience. This sentiment echoes some of the other critiques I've come across, where it was suggested that selecting individuals at random from a shopping mall might have yielded a more suitable cast. Moreover, the pacing of the film left something to be desired, as it could have been improved to enhance the overall narrative flow. Despite these criticisms, it's important to note that I did appreciate the movie overall. The storyline, cinematography, and other aspects were engaging, but the casting and pacing issues detracted from my full enjoyment and immersion in the film.",neutral
571,"""Dune: Part 2"" had the weight of expectation upon its shoulders, following the success of its predecessor. However, this highly anticipated sequel falls short of achieving the same level of excellence. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film struggles with uneven pacing, lackluster character development, and a narrative that feels rushed and heavy-handed.One of the glaring issues with ""Dune: Part 2"" is its pacing, which oscillates between dragging in the middle third and rushing through the final third. The film spends too much time on inconsequential events, leaving little room for character arcs to develop organically. Paul's transformation from a reluctant leader to a megalomaniac zealot feels particularly rushed and lacking in depth, robbing the audience of the opportunity to truly empathize with his journey. Having attended a late evening showing there were times I was actually checking my watch, unbelievably so, but I have to admit myself bored particularly past the first hour mark.Rather than feeling a drama play out in real time, we're simply told drama 'is' playing out. Its a subtle but important difference, but one which needs to be acknowledged. Unfortunately there is no sense of stakes here, instead its just characters accomplishing one task after the other until Paul can eventually become 'The Messiah'. At no point did I ever feel this was under threat, yet apparently according to what the characters are saying, that's EXACTLY how I should be feeling.Another one of my main complaints was the love story between Paul and Chani, with it feeling forced and clich√©d to the nth degree. The lack of chemistry between the two actors was distracting and the on-again, off-again nature of their romance detracted from the emotional weight their relationship is apparently supposed to carry. It's a narrative thread that we've seen countless times before, yet done better in other movies, leaving viewers feeling indifferent rather than invested; I had no real reason to care about these two, other than I was told I was supposed to by the plot. We can call Dune Part 2 a masterpiece all we want, but when the main romance and arguably main backdrop of the second installment feels corny, then we know we've got problems.The introduction of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha character also feels unnecessary and cartoonish. His role usurps that of Dave Bautista's Beast Rabban from the world-building of the first film, only to be disposed of by the end of the sequel. This decision undermines the tension that could and probably SHOULD have been built with Bautista's character and leaves audiences questioning the purpose of Butler's inclusion. Feyd Rautha felt 'evil for the sake of evil' and a mere device to give the hero's of Paul and Chani something to aim at, whilst not actually threatening to alter the plot.Despite these shortcomings, ""Dune: Part 2"" does have its strengths, particularly in its visual effects, framing, and atmosphere. Denis Villeneuve once again proves himself a master of his craft, creating stunning visuals that transport audiences to the world of Arrakis. However, these moments of visual brilliance can sometimes feel overindulgent, with scenes of desert landscapes and thumpers dragging on for longer than necessary. Credit where credit is due however....Ultimately, ""Dune: Part 2"" fails to deliver a satisfying payoff, with the Emperor's defeat feeling anticlimactic and Christopher Walken's portrayal lacking the gravitas it deserves. While the film runs for a lengthy time, almost none of it is given towards developing his character and giving the audience a reason to care about his potential affect and inclusion in the narrative. Unfortunately he just exists here as a confused looking old man, and the film is poorer for it.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a visually impressive but a narratively underwhelming sequel. While it may have been hailed as a masterpiece by some, it ultimately fails to live up to its potential. Those seeking to immerse themselves in the world of ""Dune"" would be better off sticking to the books, as the film leaves much to be desired, particularly given its lengthy runtime. As a non book reader myself, I sure know where I'll be heading now to get my Dune fix.",positive
572,"Dune Part Two
It has come to full fruition. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series might be the greatest sci-fi series in cinematic history. The new age of cinema has shown its potential to not just adapt in filmmaking but to show a great storyline and potentially become a classic in centuries to come. And I believe that with all of my heart. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series will be the sci-fi film that will share the throne as the greatest amongst the classics.It's a wild thing to say for a latest-release film, and I do understand the recency bias phenomenon among moviegoers. But I also believe Denis Dune will grow on people from time to time, as I felt that myself with Dune Part One rewatches and also my observation on the audiences latest reviews on Dune Part One rewatch.There are two eyewitnesses to this film: the novel non-readers and the readers. It is a bipartite review as to how they perceived this film, and I can say that I'm jealous of how non-readers might perceive this film. While I might see the words becoming a full visualization, I'm also trying to perceive how non-readers see its story.From this statement, it's due to how there are quite plenty of omissions and changes in the storyline from the novel, and the way I'm wording it doesn't indicate a bad thing, but it's a ""huh"" moment for me as I immersed myself in the story with a new perception. I believe most non-readers will see it as a linear, perfect storyline, but it's different for me, and this is not entirely a bad thing.To sum up the statement, Denis and Jon have done a tremendous job on the storyline and screenwriting, and I have to say it's the best decision yet to make the storyline go in the other direction. Most of the new scenes leave me in a great shock at how well told it is and how unexpectedly it turned out to be played, especially the ending.The words for this storyline are more fierce and cruel.Dune Part Two is an experience, not just a film of fiction. It is dramatic in its depth, poignant in its love story, profound and cruel in its motive, and epic in its style that's grandeur and maximized to near perfection.I'm blown away by how Denis managed to achieve this level of mastery in an adaptation of the greatest sci-fi novel in history. Dune Part Two is a masterpiece and beautifully adapted.It just gets better.Moving away from the main thematic entrance to this cinematic desert masterpiece. I just have to talk about the ingredients that make this film as spicy as it gets.The cinematography is top-notch and one of the most remarkable aspects of this film. The film was a whole 2 hours and 40 minutes of eye-catching experience to be immersed on a big screen. This film managed to capture lots of moments in this scene that'll make you go, ""Hell yeah, that's fire.""The color grading for this film has its way to be most deliberate and non-subtle but will make you feel the atmospheric changes in the film, capturing the moment so well with how it is done. You'll know what I mean here...All this couldn't be done without the creative mind of Greg Frasier and perfect visualizations by Denis Villeneuve. Reading the texts and seeing how it's done in the film is one of the blessings I felt in my cinematic experience.Hans Zimmer is truly a work of art. His craft manages to consistently elevate one after the other in his film scores. The Dune Part Two soundtrack is perfectly conveyed with the instruments played and will put you in every emotion to be felt in this film.I believe Timoth√©e Chalamet has outdone himself in this film. There are many doubts lingering about this young actor, but this film will definitely solidify them. The acting was fierce and potent enough to grip you to the edge of your seat, and I'm going to tell you to prepare for what's to come.It has always been a topic of him being overrated, but hopefully Dune Part Two will prove doubters wrong and how talented Timoth√©e actually is. One of the greatest young actors in this new era of cinema, with a wide range of acting.Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is exceptional casting that is once again unexpected. Like Timoth√©e said in an interview, he has to prove himself for this film, and now it's Austin's turn, and he's actually done it. It is not an exaggeration when the word psychotic is thrown around. He truly is...Dare I say it? Feyd-Rautha is way more psychotic and villainous than he is in the novel, and you just have to witness it.I have every word to say about each actor and actress, but I couldn't prolong it. Timoth√©e and Austin are prime examples of how well-acted this film is, and you guys have to witness others acting masterfully on the big screen.My honorable mention before ending this review is how perfectly they created the Chakobsa language.David Peterson and Denis managed to give this language depth with how dramatic the language sounds when it's spoken. It doesn't feel made up for the sake of being an incomprehensible language, but rather realistic and felt.Dune Part Two is definitely worth a watch as it's healing sci-fi and action cinema right now, and I think everyone deserves to experience this in their lifetime. Go watch it while you have the chance on the big screen!",positive

""They fly now?""
""They fly now.""Well, that was... less than compelling. I liked Part One enough to watch it twice. By the end of this one I was so sick of light brown I was craving a blueberry. I have a lot more to say about it than I want to put here now (little of it good) but I'll try to keep it short.Lots of miscasting IMO. Zendaya spends most of the film glaring and looking over her shoulder. Seriously. Her flat midwestern accent was terrifically out of place in the midst of all the other Fremen. Austin Butler looks down and to the side, like he does in every other performance (I just saw him doing nothing but in The Dead Don't Die.) Christopher Walken was a great dramatic actor but I can only see him as a joke now.Fine visual effects, but far too long getting to them. Lots of people just... looking. I thought maybe Spielberg directed it for a while. This movie really made me hate sand.

I don't think so. The scale just looked daft.Casting Christopher Walken as the Emperor was a mistake and did not work at all, what a mis-cast that was. I can't say I connected to any of the characters and it was frustrating because I wanted this movie to be epic, as it was I'd rather have spent a night letting my girlfriend pull nostril hairs out of my nose, at least it would have had tears, tension, intense emotion, laughter, and relief.I can't really be bothered to do a full review, I've given it 3 stars because of the CGI.",negative

I really Think it gave the future for sci-fi a real competition and generelly theres is a Long distance between such great Universe describtions. I love the Way that the water and the dessert are set up as two opposites and how the water plays a giant role in ""the rightful rulers og dune's"" religion!This is a must Watch!!",positive

I know that I liked this film more than part 1; however, it has enticed me to go back and watch the first again. That is what a good movie should do. If you go watch this film, please take special consideration of Paul. His character develops so amazingly. It is especially present at the end of the film. We will understand more how impactful he is. There were three themes that stuck out to me the most. Multiculturalism, Selfishness, and Revenge. These are all strong Themes.",positive

While the pacing felt slightly rushed towards the end, leaving the viewer yearning for more action, it's a testament to the engrossing narrative.

I will not exaggerate when I say that for me it is a masterpiece that I want to see again and again and again. So the director departed from the canon, the life of the Freemen is not revealed as in the book, but it is Herbert. In my opinion, Villeneuve did everything he could and did it beautifully. As for my favorite actors, Butler is the best for me, to portray Faith Rauta like that, I have gold in my limbs from his cruelty and charisma, it's incredible. The audio work is colossal.

580,"""Dune: Part Two"" is the much-anticipated sequel to the 2021 film ""Dune,"" both based on the seminal science fiction novel by Frank Herbert. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film continues the story of Paul Atreides as he navigates the treacherous politics and conflicts of the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. With stunning visuals, a compelling narrative, and a stellar cast, ""Dune: Part Two"" promises to be an immersive cinematic experience that delves deeper into the richly imagined universe of the source material.Set in a distant future where humanity has spread across the galaxy and formed a feudal society, ""Dune: Part Two"" explores themes of politics, religion, ecology, and the human condition. At the center of the story is Paul Atreides, played by Timoth√©e Chalamet, a young nobleman whose family assumes control of Arrakis, the only known source of the valuable spice melange. The spice is essential for space travel, making it the most valuable substance in the universe and the focus of intense political intrigue.In ""Dune: Part One,"" we saw Paul's family, House Atreides, betrayed by their rivals, House Harkonnen, leading to their downfall and Paul's journey into the desert, where he discovers his destiny as a prophesied messiah figure, the Kwisatz Haderach. The film ended with Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), joining forces with the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen, as they prepare to take back control of the planet.""Dune: Part Two"" picks up where the first film left off, with Paul and the Fremen launching a guerilla war against the Harkonnens and their imperial allies, the corrupt Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. As Paul embraces his role as the Kwisatz Haderach and gains the trust of the Fremen, he must also contend with the visions of the future that come with his newfound powers. These visions, which are both a blessing and a curse, show him possible futures where he becomes a savior or a tyrant, leading to internal conflict as he struggles to determine the right path.One of the central themes of ""Dune: Part Two"" is the idea of destiny versus free will. Paul's journey is guided by prophecies and ancient traditions, but he also has the ability to shape his own fate. This internal conflict is reflected in the larger political struggle for control of Arrakis, as various factions vie for power and influence, each believing they are following the path laid out for them by fate.The film also delves deeper into the ecology of Arrakis and the role of the spice melange in shaping the planet's ecosystem. The spice is produced by giant sandworms that inhabit the deserts of Arrakis, and its extraction has had a profound impact on the planet's environment. The Fremen, who have adapted to life in the harsh desert, have a deep respect for the planet and its fragile ecosystem, seeing themselves as stewards rather than exploiters.Visually, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a feast for the eyes, with stunning landscapes, intricate costumes, and cutting-edge special effects bringing Herbert's vision of Arrakis to life. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, adds to the epic feel of the story, with sweeping orchestral themes that underscore the drama and emotion of the narrative.In addition to Chalamet and Ferguson, ""Dune: Part Two"" features a talented ensemble cast, including Zendaya as Chani, a Fremen warrior and Paul's love interest; Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, Paul's father; and Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen tribe that takes Paul in. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their role, helping to flesh out the complex characters that inhabit Herbert's universe.Overall, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a worthy continuation of the story begun in the first film, expanding upon the themes and ideas introduced in ""Dune"" while setting the stage for an epic conclusion. With its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and talented cast, the film is sure to captivate audiences and further cement Villeneuve's reputation as one of the premier directors working in science fiction today.",positive
581,"The film looks great, sounds great, and generally delivers on the payoffs set up in the first film, however the magic of arrakis and the depth of all characters seem to be missing entirely.The worms are reduced to transport and war machines with no explanation of their relationship with spice and shown so often their visual impact is nonexistent by the end.No discussion of bringing water to the desert or the fremen's devotion to making the land habitable, reducing the fremen to an army of worshippers for paul who's only purpose is to choose whether or not to believe in him.We already knew from the first movie that paul would be the messiah, there was plenty of time to flesh out other characters and with everything else that was ignored, that should have been the focus. Instead, the film was more concerned with getting from one action setpiece to the next without much thought given to why or how. This leaves many scenes and character actions feeling disjointed or confusing. Gone is the internal logic of the story, replaced with raw justification for spectacle. The lore of the world is not expanded, instead it somehow shrinks as characters are killed off or have their agency stripped away for the sake of the plot with the only real new information being about the water of life (which is poorly explained with its relationship to spice and the worms, not to mention Jessica's unborn daughter).Too much wasted time for such a long film. I would normally be more generous and give it a 7 but this is far from the perfect movie it's being praised to be and even farther from a perfect science fiction movie.",positive
582,"Dune: Part 2 is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The first movie was also good, but I gave it an 8. I give this movie a 10. Timoth√©e Chalamet's acting reaches its peak with this movie. The performances of the other actors were also good, but one of them captivated me. I would even put Rebecca Ferguson's performance ahead of Timoth√©e Chalamet. She was simply mesmerizing. There's not much more to say. Because everything is obvious. It's a perfect movie. Towards the end of the movie, my smart wristband gave me a pulse alert. Because the music of the movie affected me a lot. I think it is very lucky for the Oscar nominees that the movie was not released in 2023, otherwise Oppenheimer and the other nominees would have no chance against Dune. I can already say that Dune will win all the awards at the Oscars in 2025. I bow to Denis Villeneuve and look forward to the third movie.",positive
583,"This movie is too long, to the point where much of it is boring. The story advancement could have easily been covered in <2hrs. The extra 45+ mins is just boring drawn out scenes that add no value. That should have been included in an extended version. As a result, I found myself not engaged in the story and turned if off several times, coming back to it to finish it over 3 days. Really ruined the experience for me. There are just so many scenes of people looking out over sand dunes and blowing sand that one can stand. I know the diehard fans are all going to rate this as a 10 because they've waited so long for an epic, but IMO this is a good story ruined with too much fluff.",positive
584,"Not so far ago, the cinematic experience was something special, magical if you want. That magic was created by artists, those in front and behind the camera eye. Each one of those artists have their own code, their voice in the choir of picture makers, a variety of tricks on their sleeves. Movies today, specially mainstream films, apply just one code, one voice, one trick: the capitalist one. Exceptions arises from time to time, and i'm very sorry that Villeneuve's Dune is not one of them. Herbert's work deserves it, but mr. Villeneuve and mr. Spaihts perverted, one by one, all the achievements established in the fantastic saga, a excruciating sacrifice in the name of artificially created mainstream acclaim and money, of course. Is this the same Villeneuve that directed Arrival, a well crafted science fiction movie? Big money says no, for the sake of profit. And surely is a sad happening, but we have seen that many times already. Another example that comes to mind is the last Avatar pastiche, as disappointing and devoid of soul as this last fiasco that i'm nailing now.I came from a different generation, times almost forgotten when going to cinema halls implicitly meant some brain gymnastics. Today, spoonfeeded audiences anxious of the last bombastic digital effect can't cope with something more complicated than passing screens on a game console. Because that's what Villeneuve and Spaihts had perpetrated. I've read an interview with mr. Villeneuve when Dune part 2 opened in my city. ""I don't like mesianic figures"", explained. That's ok, just the same as in Frank Herbert books. But, alas, mr. Herbert needed to create a messiah first in order to demolish later such a figure! But in this disgrace of a film, the director is eager to destroy him right from the start. And a neat job he does, for sure! In the interview, Villeneuve also said that dialogue is for theater and tv, not for films, and that's something one can ascertain without doubt seeing the movie: adolescent romantic drama based on pouty faces (Chani) engulfing the screen and, like a cheap tv soap opera, the insecure and fragile Paul Atreides (Chalamet) shouting at mama and crying for lost love. That's the way Paul Atreides, trained since he was a child in the art of war, self-defense, governance and a multitude of sciences, not forgetting the Prana-Bindu physical and mental control in the Bene Gesserit ways, who passed the Gom-Jabbar with flying colours, the best positioned candidate for being the Kwisatz Haderach, is portrayed in this foul perversion of a film: like a crybaby.What a nerve! Space Guild absent, the Mentat, human computers (every House has one: utterly omitted in this film) and the Butlerian Jihad never explained, the Bene Gesserit and the quest for the superhuman being merits only a few lines, the Corrino and the rest of the Houses, Bene Tleilax, the interrelation between all these galactic powers... too much material severed, the essence of the conflict is eliminated. How can anyone understand the importance of the spice in the Dune universe if what is used for is not even hinted? The spice must flow, but we don't know why.Navigators use the spice, that expands the mind, to fold the space and travel at interstellar distances without moving. That's the basis of the Empire's control over the galaxy, that's the plot device that ties all together, and that's the reason why who controls the spice, controls the Empire. Furthermore, the Navigators of the Guild float in an atmosphere made of spice gas, they need the spice to survive. And the drinking of the Water of Life in addition with the contact with the spice is the reason why Paul Muab-Dib becomes the Kwisatz Haderach:a male Bene Gesserit who have access to the memories of both his male and female ancestors as well as the capacity to bridge space and time with prescient ability. This wonder of epic sci fi, this marvel of a plot, all this and much more goes to the trash bin without any remorse. And doing so, cripples the meaning of the saga all the way.It's laughable to see what they made with any of the principal characters in order to appeal the target audiences. To name only one that irritates me the most, i'll go with Chani, Lyet-Kines's daughter. A new little detail overlooked, destroyed from the original tale, as many others. And a very important one: being the imperial ecologist daughter, Chani knows first hand the struggle in Arrakis from the very moment it starts. A strong female character. In 1965, Frank Herbert endowed the Dune female characters with a determination, power and self-confidence far ahead of it's own time and, as we see right now in the portrayal rendered by this film, ours. Chani was no exception: the love she feels for Paul is unbreakable (just as is Paul's in response), with no condition whatsoever. A cunning warrior, follower of the arrakean traditions with a great amount of wisdom, witness of every step that Paul takes to become the One. She understands perfectly the political movement that explains the marriage of Paul and Irulan, because she knows perfectly well that Paul's vision is exactly the same as her father had for Arrakis. She believes in the prophecies, but in Villeneuve's travesty is portrayed as an atheist, with no faith in his lover, believing he's not the One, and abandoning him at the end of the movie because Paul's gonna marry Irulan. The last straw: Chani jealous, and adding insult to injury, betraying the fundamental role of the Emperor's concubine as described in the novels! In what alternate universe this Chani is gonna have 3 babies from a man she despises utterly, as we can see in the last 30 minutes?Other absence that hurts so much is Alia-of-the-Knife: the Water of Life creates in Jessica's womb what we can call the ultimate Bene Gesserit, Alia Atreides. The one who inflicts the Atrteides Gom-Jabbar to his grandfather Vladimir Harkonnen, killing him and make him float to a worm's open mouth. The little, creepy and charming abomination that uses the Voice to overwhelm the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is sorely missed, still unborn in this disaster of adaptation. Our cinema masters choose poorly once again, because in the novel Alia is 3 years old when the facts take place. Seems more suitable for them that Paul gets all the killings, and also the shouting to the Reverend Mother. To cap it all, a few minutes later in the same scene Feyd stabs Paul (?) in the most irritating fight scene never played before: a drunk's quarrel has more appeal. A skinny wounded guy with a perforated lung, panting dramatically for the sole purpose of staying alive, slays Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the muscular Na-Baron with hundreds of knife fight training hours, a pitiful attempt in raising false stakes in the most hideous way. Even the poisoned blade in Feyd's whip (the reason why Paul can defeat him in the first novel) is omitted as well, and let's not forget that Feyd never stabs Paul. What else can be said?I will add this: i suspect one more odd event, a catastrophic rewriting for the 3rd movie. Following the pattern of cosmetic empowerment and adolescent banality √° la mode showed until now, our cinematic masters will transform Chani in the real hero of the saga. The reason that leaves me to believe that future disaster
is the artificially division invented by the filmmakers in Arrakis between the North inhabitants, mostly non-believers, and the South ones, ""fundamentalists"". This is the perfect scenario for a civil war, with Chani leading the northern ""civilized"" faction and Paul Muab-dib his southern followers. Time will tell, but let me ask you: after this disaster of a movie, what kind of denouement can we expect? A return to grace? If so, how? In three and a half years, we will see the extent of the harm. What a pity!",positive
585,"Dune part 2 is a masterclass in filmmaking, skilfully directed by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings Frank Herbert's complex universe to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.The cinematography is a visual feast, with sweeping desert landscapes and awe-inspiring set pieces that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by stellar performances from Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.Furthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer, elevates the entire experience, perfectly complementing the grandeur of the narrative.Dune Part 2 is a cinematic triumph, a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece.",neutral
586,"The storyline of this film deserves lots of praise and thatvus just the beginning. The cinematography is fantastic.. it actually brings one into the world of Arrakis. The movie shows how belief is the biggest weapon humanity can wield and also the scariest if used inappropriately. The acting from Timoth√©e is fantastic. You really see him grow into this character the Lisan Al-Gaib. There were a few acting performances that did not hit par but on the whole, this is a mega movie and a true box-office beast. I do wonder whether the oscars would try and allow this big budget blockbusters play a more prominent role in awards season.",positive
587,"Just watched on IMAX this afternoon. This is a whole new level of filmmaking. Much better than the first one (and I'm a huge fan of part one). The characters, music, visuals, everything single thing is incredibly crafted. You can actually feel the other worldly characters and stories. Heck you can even believe that Paul is a godly figure and not ""oh yeah he did it cos he's the 'chosen one'"" when the time came.Sure they changed more stuff than they did with part one but as a book fan, the changes are very well suited for on screen audience (and make more sense even). The only complaint I have is that I can't get enough of it. I need MORE! We need Part Three!",neutral
588,"There are very few perfect movies; The Goonies, Top Gun: Maverick, A Goofy Movie to name a few. This movie was a 10 if there ever was one. Perfection is the only word I can use to accurately describe it. Truly a must-see in IMAX. From beginning to end this movie will pull you in and refuse to let go. Whether you are new to the world of Dune or experienced and well versed in the lore this movie is for you. The visuals are stunning, the sound fx are brilliant, the acting, superb. If this is what Hollywood is capable of doing then I will expect more masterpieces like this one in the future. ""The Spice must flow!""",neutral
589,"Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction epic, Dune has been rewritten and filmed many times. And there are others planned for the future.However, it is necessary to watch this new release for comparison. Yes, the story and even the pronunciation of words vary from the book. However, for those that have not read the book some parts of the movie you will not like are right out of the book.The cast alone is worth watching and even though you tend to say, ""Now where have I seen that actor before,"" the actor does not stand out past the character they are portraying.The total abscence of the fj agenda makes this movie a gem.",neutral
590,"It's so rare that you look forward to a film as much as this and then aren't disappointed. It was pure gold, from every angle.Captivating story, perfectly chosen cast, stunning costumes, awe-inspiring visual effects - a true masterpiece.The film takes you on a rollercoaster of a journey, from moments of sheer excitement and adventure to chilling darkness.Part of what makes it so exhilarating is the anticipation of what's next and never truly knowing what to expect.I thought the nods to historical references were clever and the visual effects were excellent.This is a must-watch for any cinema lover.",positive
591,"It's been a minute since we've seen big screen, full-meal-deal science fiction, and Dune: Part Two tries to deliver. With sweeping special effects and a very large canvass, this film does its best to check the boxes created when the Star Wars franchise was at its zenith.But as the CGI glitz and ear-piercing sound fade, what remains is less-than-satisfying dialogue and the shopworn plot lines of ""little guy fights against inestimable odds"" and ""will two lovers find a way?""Casting is uneven. Rebecca Ferguson's screen-scorching sensuality is barely recognizable and wasted here, but the amiable Austin Butler transforms well from his turn as a sympathy-evoking Elvis into a cheerfully efficient serial killer. Once again, Javier Bardem steals scene after scene with his comically touching portrayal of destiny's true believer.Despite its flaws, this film still entertains, perhaps because we're so starved for the genre that we're more forgiving than the sand worms.But truly, if you're going all-in on a mega-production such as Dune Two, give a thought to the screenplay. As theatre attendance strives for a post-COVID comeback, the redefinition of an ""epic"" film will need to include more crisp dialogue and a tighter plot line.",positive
592,"Dune Part 2 delivers the best sequel experience ever. Every aspect, from acting to story to music, is simply outstanding. While I'm a huge fan of Timoth√©e, Austin's performance here is equally extraordinary. The storytelling is exquisite, immersing me visually more than Dune Part 1 ever did. As always, there are no words for Hans Zimmer's music. I've never paid this much attention to a movie before. Denis Villeneuve has truly outdone himself with this film, making it his best work yet. The casting is impeccable, leaving me eager for more. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece. I eagerly anticipate Part 3.",positive
593,"I find that if you're a fan of the series. And love it, then you will like the sequel. I, however, not a normal dune fan but liked part one. I found part 2 really long and way too much dialogue since they explained character in part one, and Austin Butler's character made no sense, but the special effects and acting were phenomenal. Unfortunately, it was kind of a sleeper movie where I almost fell asleep due to non action and due to overdoing the story line. It could of been done in 2 hours. All the acti g again and cgi was amazing.The ending didn't make sense but set it up for a possible third movie.",positive
594,"I don't understand all the hype? It's boring, bland. It doesn't catch on at all like the first part, too much indifferent dialog. You end up checking your smartphone. Doesn't capture the franchise at all. I'm a fan of Dune, the books, the games and the movies. But Dune part 2 should have been made completely differently. Total waste of time and very disappointing. The plot and the acting are far from what you would have expected. Its just not worth the time you spend watching this utter trash. Its in fact a taunt to the entire franchise. What s huge dissapointment. Avoid and save your time and money.",negative
595,"Awesome! Stunning! The film follows through the spirit of the books with the ever-present internal turmoil of Paul. It has the feel of mysticism of the books. The cinematography is spectacular and so is Hans Zimmer's music. The freemen and harkons are depicted really well and so is the planet Dune. At the same time, there are many details and happenings left behind, so for people who have not read the books it's a bit difficult to follow the narrative. The movie doesn't follow thoroughly the destiny of the other of the closest friends and servents of the Duke, who survived the massacre in part 1.",neutral
596,"The perfect sequel to the first movie. I have seen this movie at IMAX as Denis Villeneuve said is made for. The pacing in this movie is perfect you are not rushed in the story, there are no breaks in the narrative of the story, it is very easy to understand, to pick up and to relate to the story. The sound, the cinematography the special effects are something out of this planet, it was the first time for me in years of going to the cinema and feeling amazed about everything it was a shock, good movies still exist, Hollywood just need to leave creative people do their thing. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer makes the experience even more immersive you feel like you are there. In conclusion, this is the movie of the decade I do not think it will be something else to beat this !",positive
597,"This film has potential to be one the greatest movies of all time. Words can hardly describe what this movie made me feel. With every big fight scene, you can feel everything. The loud pounding of gunshots, the heavy clanking of swords and knifes smashing against one another. And with the small, hand-to-hand fights, you can feel the emotion, every punch, kick, stab, all of it. The acting was absolutely phenomenal, unlike any I've ever seen before.Timoth√©e Chalamet deserve all the praise he is about to gain from this film. This has to be Chalamet's best performance yet, along with many others. While not his best performance, Austin Butler absolutely delivers in this movie as Feyd Rautha. Not quite living up to antagonist performances such as Heath Ledger's Joker in Nolan's Dark Knight or co-star Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men. However he is absolutely on the new list of film antagonist. Amongst others such as Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya, this movie is packed with the greatest performances I've witnessed in a sci-fi film.Greig Fraser, oh Lord where do I even begin. This film's cinematography was absolutely stupendous! I'd put this movie's cinematography on par with such works like Linus Sandgren in La La Land and Roger Deakins in 1917, this movie has the masterful blend of color, angles, and framing. Everything about this movies cinematography set the tones perfectly and I'm one hundred percent here for it.Overall, this has got to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and I'd recommend to anybody, no matter your taste in films.",positive
598,"I read the book around when the first part of Dune was released. So I knew what would happen story-wise. But while watching part two I realized it's not just about the main plot. It's the music, it's the visuals, the sounds, the acting, the rawness.I think everything in this movie is perfect, when you see it from a visual and sound perspective.While I think the story is wonderful, I feel it was almost too fast phased. I discussed with friends who has not read the book about the story. Which they did not really understand at all times. Because of the movies fast phase in the second half of the movie.I won't discuss these specific storywise stuff. But when you see the movie from a book-perspective. The story is exceptional and rich.While I know you can't really copy-paste the book to the movie. It still contains the main plot points and does so with excellence. But I can't deny that I wanted to see some more things that was included in the book but not in the movie.Certain characters, cough cough.. Seemed to be forgotten from the first part.But overall I totally loved the movie. And I also like that it takes it's own little road to make it a ""better"" cinematic experience. But I know that some will whine about the difference between book and movie. I think it's great that they make the movie in a way that still cherish the source material but does some changes probably are necessary for production and overall experience.If you'll whine about the movie not being exactly like the book you should just go read the book. I really hope an extended cut will be released for us all to enjoy this movie in 4h instead of 3.I would perhaps put this movie in the 8.5+ area. But since this is imdb it deserves a 10. Thanks.",positive
599,"Dune: Part Two accomplishes more things than any Sci-Fi epic in the last 20 years. It not only effectively conveys the plot of the novel, but does so with great emotional density. The performances are top notch across the board. Timothee Chalamet cements his legacy as a true star, showing a wide range of emotional capital. And as far as the visuals, the film has no equal. The worm-riding sequence is one of the most awe-inspiring moments of any movie I've ever seen. The music and sound design are perfect. Clearly the better of the two films, Dune: Part Two is not just my favorite Sci-Fi film, it may be my new all-time favorite film. It's honestly that good.",positive
600,"Well where do I even begin. Review done by @RatedFairly on x.Denis Villeneuve congratulations. This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It's definetly in my top 15. Maybe top 10 or higher movies of all time. So let's break down whyMusic: Hans Zimmer. Greatest of all time. The music that is portrayed through the film is just perfection. It's fantastic. It's tasty. It's impressive and it's filled with emotions. Every scene tells a tale and a story but with the music it becomes dreamy. Absolutely fantastic to see and feel and hear.Writing: This movie actually follows the books. I haven't personally read the books but many of my close friends has and they all say they are very pleased. From a neutral point of view, the lines, the way the movie and character was shown was fantastic. How certain words and lines, like Javier Bardem put out can fill your head with a much larger picture, is exactly what this movie needs. So well ""world building"". I am just deeply impressed. It wasn't too much comedy or jokes, but the perfect amount that got everyone in the cinema laughing, to people in the cinema crying and being impressed by the scenery.Visuals: Breathtaking. Fantastic. I don't have enough words. Some of the CGI (like 2 or 3 small parts) I found a bit odd but that's just movies for you. The visuals were fantastic. Denis is right. Some scenes you don't need words or lines to portray emotion or set the scene. Music and certain visuals will do it for you. Scary, Epic, Insane, Love. Everything was perfect. I am deeply impressed. Only movie recently with better visuals was Avatar 2 and that says A LOT!!!Characters: I don't want to make this way to long but wow. Timothy killed it. Javier killed it. Austin killed it. Zendaya killed it. Every actor killed it. Stellan was just PERFECT AGAIN!!! Scary as a ...... just fantastic man. So well done. Acting was perfect. Switching between emotions. I have just no words. This movie was just fantastic.Like I put on x, I rate this movie 8.8 out of time. Which is a high for me. I have very few films above 9 but this was one of those that was really close.",positive
601,"I've read the original book several times, and have seen the '84 movie (both versions) and the SyFy channel miniseries. While both missed something, it wasn't as bad as accelerating the timeliness and leaving out key scenes that would make a third movie, Dune Messiah, more plausible. Such as in previous versions Alia, Paul's sister, was the one to kill Vladimir Harkonen. This is what lead to her eventual insanity, as was shown in the SyFy channel's Children of Dune. The cinematography of the movie was great, but splitting the Fremen like how Islam is split was a poor choice. The choice to make the Fremen of two sects might have been a good way to go given how religious sects go, but in MY opinion it was the wrong way to go. And making Paul and even more reluctant hero also weakened the movie. The quickening of the timeliness was foolish because in the book and previous versions, it took time for Paul to learn what he needed to learn and for the love between Paul and Chani to develop. If this had been done properly then the story would have been better.",positive
602,"Dune: Part Two - A Triumphant Return to Arrakis (10/10)
Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two isn't just a sequel; it's a cinematic culmination, a harmonious fusion of awe-inspiring visuals, profound storytelling, and pulse-pounding action. This film transcends the limitations of mere science fiction, establishing itself as a grand operatic experience that will leave audiences breathless.Having laid the groundwork in the first part, Villeneuve dives headfirst into the heart of Frank Herbert's legendary saga. Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) is no longer the wide-eyed Duke's son. Haunted by visions and burdened by his messianic destiny, he walks a tightrope between prophecy and peril. Chalamet delivers a powerful performance, capturing Paul's inner turmoil and burgeoning leadership with remarkable nuance.The supporting cast shines even brighter. Zendaya's Chani emerges as a formidable warrior and Paul's emotional anchor. Rebecca Ferguson masterfully portrays Lady Jessica, a mother caught between love for her son and the machinations of the Bene Gesserit. Javier Bardem brings a gravitas and charisma to Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen, that resonates deeply. Each character is meticulously crafted, their motivations and complexities woven into the narrative tapestry.Visually, Dune: Part Two is a feast for the eyes. The filmmakers have conjured a breathtaking vision of Arrakis, a desert planet teeming with danger and wonder. The sandworms are even more awe-inspiring, their gargantuan forms slithering across the dunes in sequences that redefine cinematic scale. The costume and production design are equally impressive, transporting viewers to a world both familiar and alien.The action sequences are masterfully choreographed and executed. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of combat, but the violence serves a purpose, highlighting the stakes of Paul's struggle. The use of sound design further elevates these scenes, with the thunderous roar of the sandworms and the whine of lasguns creating a truly immersive experience.But Dune: Part Two is more than just spectacle. Villeneuve delves deeper into Herbert's themes of ecology, colonialism, and religious fanaticism. The film explores the consequences of unchecked ambition and the dangers of succumbing to messianic fervor. Paul's journey is not a clear-cut path to heroism; it's a harrowing exploration of power and its corrupting influence.The score by Hans Zimmer deserves special mention. It's a powerful and evocative soundscape that perfectly complements the film's visuals and emotional core. The music throbs with a primal energy, mirroring the harsh beauty of Arrakis and the inner struggles of its characters.Dune: Part Two is a rare cinematic achievement. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, prompting reflection and discussion. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, a visually stunning epic that resonates on a deeply human level. This is not just a must-see for fans of the first film; it's a must-see for anyone who appreciates grand, thought-provoking cinema. In a world saturated with sequels and franchises, Dune: Part Two stands out as a masterpiece, a film that fully deserves its perfect 10/10 rating.",positive
603,"Let me start by saying I think this is an excellent film but I'm as conflicted as I am impressed.Rather than being the second half of the book adaptation of Dune - this brings in more of the ideological analysis and political power play that exist across the galaxy. The bulk of this might've been influenced by ""Dune Messiah"" but the roles are impacted, changed, squandered, enhanced and fleshed out.For a long film, less book plot transpires from Dune. The film is asking for a part 3, but may have lost a good portion of its fan base with just how far DV has departed or abandoned aspects of the books.No longer are we given a visual or narrated insight into Paul's insight and visions of the past, present and future.His sister remains unborn add therefore her character is developed as a sentient foetus, the victory of taking back Arrakis is swift despite easily taking the entire runtime of the whole of David Lynch's film and giving us more of a sense of her power and precociousness. Her life as as the Dukes daughter and something more is denied in this representation and Chani is transformed to the opposite of her character in the book. For me this choice to ""empower"" Chani's stance to one of understanding beyond her books character means we lost seeing her wisdom and belief. With the time dedicated, her relationship with Paul is left estranged rather than a deep believer. There was time to develop other characters to portray this revisionism and it is largely borrow from the second novel, Dune Messiah. Exploring how the Bene Gesserates seed prophetic stories and female children to manipulate and control the Houses and the reach of their power over 90 generations and more. No montage and voice over used or needed but the passage of time felt long enough to introduce and develop Paul's sister - she is missed most in the last act. While Chani becomes the voice of decent, Josh Brolin as Gurney becomes sycophantic almost.The choices fit our current world tensions somewhat but DV withholds enough of the book to justify a third film. Too much in my opinion to make this a satisfying film.None book readers/listeners and fans will feel short changed from two films of this running time. There was easily more to develop and conclude AND allow for multiple more films. This feels more like a bargaining tool with WB for a franchise.If the internal voice was silenced from Paul it also distances him from the audience. He is less noble and more vengeful. And the final act seems hurried. With critical fights less impressive and certain kills given to the protagonist.So I am finding this a mixed bag with David Lynch giving more accuracy and conclusion of the book's narrative. However, in Hollywood money is made in retention and sequels. DV now has a divergent version of Dune to bring around. The book spawned several official sequels and this could be the money maker that saves WB.The visuals and large scale action is original and bold. Glorious acting by all save Emperor Walken. No gravitas or strategic brilliance on display. I found this weak casting. Austin Butler surprised me.I felt that the Harkonnen perverse natures was underplayed. Partly because since the book was written, homosexuality is not the non-acceptable sensibility it was in Frank Herbert's time. Also I feel that Hollywood wants money to roll in from countries where representation of such meets censorship.The cinematography and the restraint shown with the Worms really pay off. If I had not read the books, I think this would be up there as a 9/10 that I gave the more promising and faithful part one. So if part 3 now happens and works better for these choices as the plot and character arcs continue then this might deserve more praise.As it stands this may have undermined the book fanbase but gained modern audience satisfaction. Could Chani be a willing and understanding concubine knowing she would be his true love but accept a political marriage in this day and age?It certainly leaves lots to be discussed and hopefully more to be seen. I truly hope this is successful and I understand the posture. I can't help but feel two films was sufficient for Dune. Frank Herbert, it could be argued had to write Messiah to capitalise on his own success and to bridge and retrofit Dune to enable Children of Dune. This way perhaps DV has positioned himself more strategically. Does he have the stamina for the journey to continue? I hope the answer is a YES from Legendary and WB.",positive
604,"Less than 0.1% of Earth's human population will agree with me. You are all going to think I am a weak, stupid panzee who needs to shut up. There are two main problems with this movie; the message and the violence.The message says; fight and kill at all costs to preserve yourself, slaughter and humiliate your enemies, use people's beliefs to control them, and be a good leader by ruling through fear. In the Dune universe, it is the year 10,191, humans (and humanoids) have STILL not learned to work together. The movie is a great representation of today's world, with all the kingdoms of the earth deceiving and fighting one another, trying to be the king of the hill even if the rest of the world must suffer, except, in the movie, it is just more brutal and barbaric than the slow politics of today's world.Unfortunately, because of the big name actors and all the money made to promote the film, it's ""critically acclaimed"". Back when I was a teenager, I would have loved this movie, but I now, I have come to learn that violence and country nationalism is preventing us from actually making the world a better place.I could go on, but no one is reading this far into my review.",positive
605,"It is rare for a film to meet the monumental expectations that the world has cast upon Dune Pt. 2. This film shatters all of them. In his return to Arrakis, director Denis Villeneuve flexes every directorial muscle we've come to expect from him and then some. Dune Part 2 is an instant classic, the best science fiction film produced this century, and proof that in the cinema, imagery and sound remain king. Fans of the book and newcomers to the world of Dune will be in awe of the secrets that lay waiting for them in the desert of Arrakis.

607,"Christopher Nolan described the film as Denis' The Empire Strikes Back and once you see the film, you understand why... It's an absolute cinematic masterpiece! A film that stuns you with its cinematography, gives you goosebumps with its music and leaves you in awe with its performances.Denis Villeneuve's filmography and how it gets better with every film is simply remarkable, and probably he's got the best one yet with Dune Part Two. His sense of direction and his vision for the film and franchise is beyond anything and it shows... you can see the grandiosity, and yet the stillness in so many of the scenes.The story (for those who aren't aware) keeps getting bigger as it progresses, and the film keeps levelling up! The silence is golden because then the shots can speak more than the dialogue. There are also scenes which amp you up like nothing else.Alongside that ride, is Grieg Fraser with the best cinematography you can see on the big screen, especially the IMAX screen. Every frame is a treat to watch, the details, the scenes, everything. There's no small or big scene here, everything is a cinematic experience, the still scenes and the magnanimous moments.Timothee Chalamet is showcasing his best work here and we aren't talking about it enough already... There's a stillness, and stoicism in his performance, but also ferocity and hunger, the combination of elements that bring out the best of him on the screen and elevate his performance.While Zendaya's role seemed more of a supporting one, rather than a lead one, it is an important role where much of her performance is through her eyes more than anything else... and there's so much power in that.You cannot talk about Dune Part Two and not talk about Rebecca Ferguson, her command over her character and the power-packed performance she has delivered, you're in awe every time she's on screen.Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, and Josh Brolin are all exceptional... but there's another standout name that yet again delivers brilliantly, Austin Butler. What a scene-stealer! His voice, his look, his personality, a fiery role in this already exceptional cast.The impact Dune Part Two makes is incomplete without the music of Hans Zimmer. Literal goosebumps are what you're able to feel, the elevation that it brings to the scenes and how you're able to feel what's about to come only with the music is extraordinary.There are some films when you say, ""This is Cinema""... and this is one of them. In such instances, even if there are a few flaws here and there, you don't want to notice them when everything else is so good and so many elements are appreciable at such high capacity. You cannot watch this film just once.",positive
608,"Dune 2, the Avatar and the Titanic. The three movies anyone who can, should watch on the big screen.This movie was made to impress, and it succeeded. It's been a while since the last time I enjoyed the cinema experience this much. Not to mention that throughout the movie I DIDN'T look at the time not even once, to see how much is left. Rare for me. This movie had my full attention from start to finish for 2h40+min and I wish it were even longer. And this is coming from someone who will generally watch movies in 2, 3 or more increments at home.. yep. But not with Dune 2. An amazing movie, loved it. Can't wait to watch it again.",positive

I can't imagine it being possible to adapt the Frank Herbert's 1965 novel into film any better than Denis Villeneuve has done. It's a highly-refined masterpiece, a monumental achievement in science fiction that's brimming with thematic complexity. Movies like this should be a wake-up call to Hollywood, encouraging the industry to take more risk and let the creative geniuses (like Denis) cook without compromise.The Hans Zimmer soundtrack, eye-watering cinematography, gorgeous visuals, top-notch acting and intricate storyline were all woven into perfection. Every shot is teeming with life. There wasn't a dull part about Dune 2, from the moment the bass induced voice boomed through my lungs to the end credits, I felt completely captivated.I'll be going back to the theatre to watch Dune: Part 2 again ASAP.",neutral

Not only was it incredibly visually beautiful but the story, acting, costumes, even the CGI just incredible. I would happily go and see this film again. I am looking forward to part 3 that's for sure. I just hope it can live up to the quality of part 2. I guess we will have to wait and see for that one but absolutely a must see film!",positive
611,"It's the peak of Hollywood production and yet it's a snoozefest. What happens when you have an overly polished cinematic experience packed with characters that have no real personalities or depth of any kind? You get Dune 1 & 2. I found my self sluggish in my chair falling asleep at multiple points in the movie. The studio must have required a 2 1/2+ hour movie because the movie was packed extremely slow scenes, actual slow-mo scenes, and scenes of landscapes with zero substance. The movie could have easily crammed in 45 minutes if they wanted to. I figured after the first one that it surely couldn't be another sleeper and boy was I wrong. If there's a Dune 3 I'll bring my neck pillow next time.",neutral
612,"As someone who is usually not into Sci-fi, Dune 2 surprised me even more than Dune 1. Especially the black and white fight scene was something else. The character development in just this one movie is outstanding and the actors all excell. I wish they could get an Oscar each. It's a well thought through movie with only minor rushed moments. But at the same time, I am grateful that the screentime wasn't wasted on fight scenes but rather focused on conversations and non verbal communication between the characters. I can highly recommend this movie to anyone. Even to those who usually don't like sci-fi. It's a must see, iconic movie.",positive
613,"Sorry, but I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews at all, because compared to the original, the desert planet from 1984, this remake unfortunately can't keep up at all, not keep up with the acting performance, not with the science fiction elements, which were already more imaginative and better in 1984 than in the current Vision version, and certainly not with the mysticism that was transported over to the original. The main actor would have been better off in a children's movie epic, but he came across as sympathetic but by no means like a leader. In addition, the intellect lacked physical strength and size. The film, which was performed and presented much too loudly, unfortunately disappointed me all along the line. It is better to enjoy the original.",neutral
614,"I went in blind, aware of the hype and praise but giving it a fair chance.First of all, there are some great scenes, no doubt. The first 45 minutes were pretty good.However, it is simply too long. Too long means it gets boring and monotonous, and like some astute critics have said, the problem of it lingers in the question of, ""why should I care?"". Sure, there are religious and political elements that carry truth, but ultimately they come across as cliche.Basically, you have a quasi biblical savior story here (I guess you can just compare it to Neo in the Matrix), with his journey of being the ""one"", the savior. The problem is: we've seen it all before.As much as I was immersed in the visuals and interesting and grand visual scenes, by the one hour point, u couldn't help but to check my watch and how much time was left. Then, it picked up again for fifteen minutes before becoming boring again.This will suffice as a sci fi experience, and I can see fans of the book loving it maybe, but it just lost me about halfway through. I won't deny the reviews and arguments that say part I was probably better.Masterpiece? Certain ""scenes"" scattered about it were, but overall, it is just too long and needs serious editing to be a true one.5/10.",positive

616,"Fully loaded with testosterone. Incredibly impressive. When I watched the first episode, I said it sounded like a star wars series, and I saw that I was absolutely right in the 2nd episode. It seems like it will be a series as enjoyable as star wars. Thank God. The cast, the costumes, the scenes are as if designed by another being, it makes you think that it cannot be a human being who made this film.

617,"I've never given a perfect score as I don't believe perfection can ever be achieved yet Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the incredibly complex and convoluted world of Dune is pure genius. It's better than 9 stars. When I go to see any movie version of a book it is with the low expectations of hoping to see something reasonably close to the writer's vision. Villeneuve, however, makes major revisions to the story line and its focus and yet weaves all the depth and meaning Frank Herbert crafted into his story in a little over two hour viewing time. And the cinematography is stunning. A masterpiece by one of today's best directors.",positive

619,"Everything from the cinematography, the score, the acting, the script just, simply, incredible. This is everything that cinema needs in this time of poorly written and directed cash grabs. You can tell when you watch Dune Part 2 that heart and soul has gone into everything in this film. I loved the first and was unsure if it could possibly be topped by Denis Villneuve has done it again with what I am certain is his best work.If you're scared of Sci-fi films or unsure on Sci-fi films it is not that sci-fiey, it's very much a story of revenge, relationships and heart.Go to the cinema today and WATCH DUNE PART2!",positive
620,"Fantastic film. The sound was incredible. Great film, super enjoyable, enough action to offset slower parts, the film just builds in intensity to a fantastic climax. Just blown away... when i walked out of the theater, there was an older gentlemen, and he looked shell shocked... he looked at me and said, ""Oh my God that was an amazing film!""... just saw it tonight, (Friday, Mar 1) with my son and I'm taking my other son tomorrow, its that good...

Don't get me wrong, the movie was, beyond a doubt, monumental, as it should, but the slow scenes felt too long, whereas the battles seemed to play on fast forward; wham, bang, thank you ma'am. What I mean, everything seemed too easy for the protagonist with little or no preparation and tactical planning. That said, although I have read the novels, and can compare, all of this felt that corners have been cut, and a lot, even for a movie over 2,5 hrs long...",neutral
622,"Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful film that is sure to leave a lasting impression. The story is epic in scope, yet it never loses sight of the personal stakes involved. The characters are complex and well-developed, and the performances are top-notch.

The music is also incredible, and it really helps to create an immersive and atmospheric experience.Overall, Dune: Part Two is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It is a must-see for fans of science fiction, epic films, and great acting. I highly recommend it !!",positive
623,"The universe they've created is amazing. The movie is a visual and audio masterpiece. However, the script is written so bad and the whole movie is so RUSHED.We get zero character development throughout the movie. Feyd-Rautha joins the movie and gets, what, around 10 mins screen time in total? And then he dies in a non-sense fight scene when he already defeated and put Paul on the ground and stabbed him. Such an interesting character and we learn NOTHING about him, then he dies like it's nothing.We learn ALMOST NOTHING about the universe and all the technology they have. There is zero story depth in this movie. This universe needs a much better lore but this is not something you can get from Villeneuve.Take half of the story in this movie and you can make another 3 hours Oscar movie with that by giving some depth to the story - so sad and disappointing work from an overrated director.",positive
624,"I read the first two books in the series in the early '70s and saw David Lynch's movie sometime in the '80s. I was prepared to be impressed (due to all the glowing reviews and box office success that Dune Parts 1 and 2 received). I just watched them back to back and have to say I am mightily UNimpressed. Since I only remember the major plot points I wasn't necessarily irked by what appear to be substantial changes in characterization as noted by other reviewers, although I do miss the powerful, lisping child Alia from Lynch's movie. (By the time the kid's born in this movie she's already going to be, like, 3 years old!)Sadly, there was a whole lot of other stuff that was very irksome indeed. I thought the acting was no more than passable, with Chalamet's performance drier than Arrakis itself.The special effects look good but by now gorgeous special effects are par for the course. Although - since so much of the movie took place at dusk or night or indoors - you often couldn't really see much anyway, so there's that.A gripe: How come if you stick a single thumper in the sand in about a minute and a half you've got a huge worm approaching and yet, you can have a few hundred fighters charging in all directions as they fight hand to hand, like so many two-legged hors d'oeuvres... and what? There's only deaf sandworms in that area?And another: What's with all this sword fighting, anyway? You telling me they couldn't invent a projectile gun or a ray weapon that would somehow slow down just at the point of reaching its target so as to enter the vaunted personal force field / aura? Even if not, a lot of the bad guys are shown dying, their force fields dimming as somebody slashes them with a swiftly whizzing sword which is being wielded at such speed that it never should have gotten through the force field at all.Also: The movie is at pains to show (as in the book) that you have to be careful in the desert to ""sand walk"" so as not to attract any worms. Except of course when you don't have to be doing that at all: like during the aforementioned fighting or when somebody may traipse up (and not ""sand traipse"", either) a very high dune (to get yet another glorious view - and is this the first such shot or the 15th milking of same? - into the distance) and apparently no worm can detect it. Maybe they had all just had a really big dinner?All in all I thought it was a pretty boring movie and the first one, while better, wasn't all that exciting, either. So, after this snoozefest _finally_ approaches its end we realize there's going to have to be a Part 3 before you get anything to actually happen in the Holy War? Not for me, thanks.",positive
625,"This is the peak of a sci-fi movie. Everything blends perfectly in this movie from the cast, the action, the way the plots transit, and the AMAZING music that complements the storytelling. I went into the cinema with a high expectation after three years of waiting but I was still joyfully amazed! I will definitely watch it again and again once every month to appreciate the full beauty of the design.Denis did an amazing job elevating the story created over forty years ago, presenting it in such a classic, decent, and even luxurious taste.The only pity I feel is that Denis didn't make it a 3.5-hour film or even break it into two parts. The pace could be a bit rushy. I just cannot get enough of it!!",positive
626,"Dune: Part Two is the greatest example of why movie theaters will never die. Going to the theaters and seeing a movie is an event, and it should be entertaining and enjoyable enough to leave a lasting impact. Dune: Part Two does exactly this in a runtime that would be considered long, but never once slows down or loses its quality. The main cast in this film in excellent-Chalamet, Ferguson, Zendaya and Butler deliver top-tier performances that I believe will get their own recognition at next year's academy awards.Villeneuve has already proven to be a fantastic director, but I think he has the chance to be the greatest science fiction director of all time. With films like this and part one, The Arrival and Blade Runner 2049-I think it's safe to say we are in great hands and hopefully the content of the Dune Saga will only grow, and I trust Villeneuve to deliver another excellent picture with Dune Messiah and his next couple of films.If you haven't seen this movie yet, please do yourself the favor of seeing it on the biggest possible screen you can with the best sound. It really enhances the film and its visuals, score and sound. Without movie theaters, we would never get films as grand and epic as this one is, and I don't think anyone should miss out on the opportunity to see this adaptation of Frank Herbert's magnum opus.",positive
627,"""Dune: Part 2"" is an absolute masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Denis Villeneuve's visionary direction coupled with Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing score creates an unparalleled cinematic experience. The music alone is enough to transport you to the hauntingly beautiful world of Arrakis, but combined with stunning visuals and a compelling narrative, it elevates the film to greatness.One of the standout aspects of ""Dune: Part 2"" is its lingering kind of vibe, which immerses the audience into the rich tapestry of the Dune universe. From the vast deserts to the intricate politics, every detail is meticulously crafted, making the world feel both expansive and lived-in. This attention to detail extends to the characters as well, each of whom is brought to life with depth and complexity.Story-wise, ""Dune: Part 2"" is driven and never feels out of touch. The film maintains a calm pace, allowing the tension to simmer and build gradually. Every scene feels purposeful, leading to a climactic conclusion that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Villeneuve masterfully balances exposition with action, ensuring that the audience is always engaged.One of the most impressive aspects of ""Dune: Part 2"" is its ability to convey a sense of scale. From the towering sandworms to the sprawling cities, everything feels epic in scope. Yet, amidst the grandeur, there is also an intimacy to the story, as it explores themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.The performances in ""Dune: Part 2"" are nothing short of stellar. Timoth√©e Chalamet shines as the conflicted hero, Paul Atreides, bringing both vulnerability and strength to the role. Rebecca Ferguson is equally compelling as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, while Oscar Isaac delivers a commanding performance as Duke Leto Atreides. The supporting cast, including Zendaya, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem, also deliver standout performances, adding depth and texture to the film.Overall, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a triumph of filmmaking. It's rare to find a movie that excels on so many levels, but Villeneuve has managed to create a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come. Whether you're a fan of science fiction or simply appreciate great storytelling, ""Dune: Part 2"" is not to be missed.",positive

Denis Villeneuve's direction is nothing short of extraordinary, and the performances are top-notch.

So heed my advice: don't just see Dune: Part Two, experience it. Let its grandeur wash over you, and revel in the magic of cinema at its finest.Whether you're a fan of the book or new to the universe, Dune: Part Two will captivate you from start to finish.

629,"Dune Part 2 is a breathtaking visual extravaganza that not only provides the next chapter in the Dune Universe but also takes you on a spiritual journey. The film begins where the last film left off,We see Paul and his Mother Lady Jessica integrate within the culture of Fremen and just like the first film the culture and customs of the Fremen are explained seamlessly. They have their own language,their religion and prophecies,the way they value and preserve water is also explained. The cast just like the last film is phenomenal and everyone just crushes it on the screen. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson once again carry the emotional heft of the story perfectly as Paul Atreides accepts his place as the Messiah while Lady Jessica becomes a spiritual leader to the Fremen because of her Bene Gesserit past. Javier Bardem and Zendaya get to shine as Stilgar and Chani respectively. Stilgar's belief in the prophecy and it's implications is conveyed exceptionally by Mr Bardem while Zendaya does a great job as Chani a brave fremen soldier who loves Paul but is constantly at loggerheads with the prophecy. Austin Butler as Feud Ratha stands out immensely. He is ferocious, blood thirsty and a psychotic maniac. Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan is contemplative and devoted to her father but does not have much to do in the story. The cinematography in this movie by Greg Frasier exceeds expectations and it should definitely be watched on the biggest screen possible. This film also has a lot more action than the first film and the action scenes are visceral and very entertaining to watch on the big screen. This film overall is a satisfying conclusion to the story setup in the first installment even though this film definitely sets up future installments. The score by Hans Zimmer is epic which might be an understatement but the score arouses you when Paul ascends and take his place as the Lisan-Al Ghaib. The score during the action scenes will also pump you up. Director Denis Villenueue understands that despite the epic scope of this film it still is Paul's journey and he takes it to fruition here. An absolute sure shot recommend, One of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had.",positive
630,How often these days can you say a sequel surpasses the first film? Now I understand that this is technically a second part of one whole story however the depth and scale of this film is remarkable that deserves commendation to all involved who have pushed it beyond the first film in every way. It is truly a masterpiece - a film that will be talked about for generations and one that will undoubtedly become a classic of cinema. A book that many thought would be impossible to fully convey through film has finally had its triumph on the big screen thanks to the mastermind that is Denis Villenevue.,neutral
631,"Despite Part One largely following the plot of the book quite closely, Part Two takes the film series into unknown territory. Too much of the book has been cut or drastically changed throughout Part Two.The dialogue has also taken a hit, being overly simplified for modern audiances.The pacing is hit-and-miss with the movie seeming to rush past major plot points in places and then taking seemingly forever to progress past others.A number of desert scenes also look incredibly fake whereas Part One was almost seemless with the CGI sand not detracting from the watchability of the film.The film is watchable, just not as enjoyable as the first film.",neutral
632,"This is how to feed the beast known as fans of DUNE
The visuals the sound. The atmosphere. It was just full package.Though there were a few things I kinda wanted to get more the story around instead of the blissful visuals with no dialogue. I tried to nitpick on the cgi but i found it stunning.More of the Bene Gesserits would have been perfect
The lack of certain character in the ending was a strange choice? Alia & her Gom Jabbar?The lack of ""the weirding way"" & more focus on religious fanatics & brute violence was a bold choice
But it did kind of work with the storytelling.As with all movies they tend to stray a bit from the source. But I really enjoyed it.And this movie can proudly crown itself a sequel better than the first instalment.Well done.",positive
633,"Denis Villeneuve's continuation of Frank Herbert's epic ""Dune"" delivers a cinematic experience that is both awe-inspiring and demanding.The film maintains the visual grandeur of its predecessor, presenting the expansive desert landscapes of Arrakis in breathtaking detail. Villeneuve continues to employ outstanding special effects and meticulously crafted sets that fully immerse the audience in the world of ""Dune.""Hans Zimmer's score once again provides an impressive musical backdrop that perfectly complements the film's mood. The music enhances the emotional depth of the scenes, creating an atmospheric richness that captivates the viewer. Zimmer's powerful and evocative soundtrack significantly contributes to the film's epic feel.The performances are consistently strong. Timoth√©e Chalamet portrays Paul Atreides with a blend of vulnerability and resolve, making his journey as a rising leader believable. Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, while Zendaya takes on a more prominent role as Chani, with her chemistry with Chalamet being notably palpable. Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Baron Harkonnen and Javier Bardem as Stilgar bring necessary depth and intensity to their roles.However, a notable critique is the film's occasional sluggishness. While the detailed portrayal of the world and character development is appreciated, the narrative sometimes drags. Some scenes feel extended and could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a brisker pace. This languid pacing can occasionally pull the viewer out of the story and diminish the suspense.Overall, the film is an immensely powerful continuation that impresses both visually and audibly. Hans Zimmer's music and the strong performances contribute significantly to the film's atmosphere. Despite the episodic slow spots, which can make the viewing experience somewhat taxing, the film remains essential for fans of the first part and the science fiction genre who are ready to engage in a profound and visually opulent adventure.",positive
634,"I'm sorry, but despite all the hype,
Villeneuve has made just two long boring movies, with flat. Cold characters that never make you get involved or to care for what they are doing. Soundtrack is just a lot of noise trying to overwhelm you, but also extremely boring and often annoying, what a waste, they could have helped to make every scene more moving. It only makes sense for the Harkonnen world, that is supposed to be disgusting. The visuals are quite great for the Harkonnen, obviously drinking from Giger's ideas, which is good, since he was the one involved in Jodorowsky's Dune for this matter. Even the worms are not so impressive and have a flat-worm ""personality"" sorry for the bad joke. I guess CGI is also making everything more flat, grey, and false. I think Javier Bardem's performance is one of the few things that gives a little authenticity to the story. Amazingly enough, I probably would prefer Lynch's Dune, if they released his original 5 hours cut.",positive
635,"I don't often rate a movie a 10, my favorites are usually 8 or 9. But this is the definition of the 10, looks and personality! In all seriousness Denis Villeneuve created something that can only be described as huge, epic, grandiose while still developing characters and applying beautiful detail. I love how he set up so many things in the first film to be paid off in part two, shots of the dessert mouse Maud Dib, Paul's awareness of Gurney Halleck's gate...
Javier Bardem as Stilgar absolutely crushes it. He couldn't be better and deserves Oscar(another) recognition. Timothy goes from a boy in the first to leading man that demands your attention, both as an actor an in his character.I'm a Dune reader, and of course things had to be cut from the book but I appreciate DV's selectiveness to make it a believable universe. Very rarely does this happen but the movies may just outshine the source material.I've never watched at 3 hour movie and wished it was 5. Though it will probably be years I can't wait for Dune Messiah.",positive
636,"Absolutely mesmerising from start to finish, a masterclass in storytelling and a visual spectacle... Dune part 2 was executed to perfection and is a love letter to the fans who've read the book along with the people who haven't, I strongly suggest reading the book as Villeneuve leaves a lot unsaid (a lot of internal monologue within the book) all while implying it through the actions of the characters, and as someone who has read the book, it was so wonderful to experience that. The film itself is truly beautiful, heartbreaking and full of lessons within lessons that give a true insight into the struggles of people in our world. I think the film truly encapsulates the idea of 'there are no sides' that the books tried so hard to impart, thank you Denis Villeneuve for bringing a story I loved so much, to life, in the most spectacular fashion.",positive
637,"Dune 2 is as good as an adaptation in film form can be. Casting, acting, world building, sound, cinematography, everything is great.Timoth√©e Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson are the stars of the show and both perfectly deliver the transition to manipulative, unsympathetic characters. Compared to the first one where they are victims of betrayal and you feel for their loss, in this one you only feel sympathy for them until you realize the only reason is knowing the Harkonnen are so much worse. Paul is not a hero, something the first movie didn't make clear.The rest of the cast is great. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgard are great as usual. Dave Bautista has surprising range and seems to do his best work with Villeneuve on the helm. I'm seeing a lot of praise for Austin Butler and his performance was good, but not anything extraordinary. His character is a psychopath and doesn't leave much room for subtlety. Zendaya is good, but in the beginning it feels like she's replaying her character from Spider Man. She has only two modes, annoyed and concerned. She does much better on the second half. Christopher Walken is great, obviously, but it was distracting to cast such a well-known actor as a character that wasn't even shown before and who is very reserved and secluded by the very nature of his role.The movie is almost 3 hours long and it didn't feel that much, but it had some minor pacing issues. It feels rushed at some points and I think it lacked some transition scenes. For instance, I wanted to see more transitions with spaceships in space, like we see once in the first one. They make the vast distances between planets clearer and increase the sense of isolation and remoteness of Arrakis. The movie doesn't really feel like an interplanetary epic. It feels like everything is happening very close.I wish the role of spice was made clearer in the first one and it wasn't, so I was expecting that in this one and I was disappointed it was overlooked again. Without showing the navigators, their role and the transformations they go through, the spice feels more like a McGuffin than an integral part of the plot. I'm not a fan of the books but I know the navigators are really introduced only in Messiah. However, I think having an earlier hint of their role and the real importance of spice would make the stakes clearer, specially when we see Paul's visions about the future and his decision to go through with it, knowing what will happen.Overall, its few minor flaws are due to things that are missing, and I'm sure Villeneuve had to make many hard decisions about what to leave out of the movie to keep the runtime reasonable.",positive
638,"Dune Part Two was a perfect sequel to Villeneuve's first part. He accomplished all of the book's major plot points while also delivering stunning performances and visuals, a fantastic execution of unexpected humor with a passionate performance from Javier Bardem.Most films in recent years only dream of having the brilliance of this film and much of that is due to the director of photography, Greig Fraser, one of the best. This film will be remembered as one of the ziggurats of modern science fiction and deserves all the laurels it will receive.It hasn't been long since a franchise and a singular film captivated and demonstrated so much passion pouring onto the screen. This story, these characters, this planet. Dune comes to fight for its place in the history of science fiction cinema. It's a disservice to the sound and photography experience not to see this film in IMAX, you feel part of each scene.Fantastic filmZendaya is a true actress.",positive

The music from Hans Zimmer combine perfect with movie scenes. The script was extremely well written and perfectly thought through. It's have a very very good story, has a good action and has a little bit romantic but not much. When you watch this movie you feel every scene with emotional. Finally my opinion are a 11/10 because it has every think in it. For example
It has action, a little bit romantic and The story takes time from dune 1 to dune 2.",positive
640,No doubt this is one of the greatest sci fi movie ever. It just surpasses its predecessor with ease. Its more deep and amazing. It is more character driven story with great character development of paul atriedis with chani more in the story. Its scifi political relegious all mix into one masterpiece. This film has taken me over with its greatness. Along with beautiful cinematography and design. All the characters have great presence inside the narrative. The movie's pacing is so great as it does not feels bored or stretched. Paul's character change is really good how be becomes a great deal in the movie.,positive
641,"As great as the visuals are, the cgi, the special effects, the explosions, the humongous digital sets, the ships & vehicles, the lore and the look, the movie has zero substance, like a crash test dummy with half a brain. Dune One had the experience of not seeing these visuals before, but now that they're established, so Two feels like a retread and turns into one of Villenueve's more blander efforts. Now, of course, I'm criticizing a $100,000,000 production with some of the greatest crews, actors and director of a generation, but sorry, it fell short for me. Will look forward to Messiah, hoping for some more heart and guts.",positive
642,"LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS!This film being a masterpiece is simply an understatement. It's practically perfect. I genuinely have not a single critique that I can think of. This is the best experience with a film I probably have ever had.I'm going to split this up into two parts, the first without spoilers and the second half will contain some pretty big spoilers that I need to address.Spoiler Free:Where do I even begin... from the very beginning scene you can tell this is going to be phenomenal. If you liked Dune 2021 at least a faint bit you will most likely love this. Everything from the first film is elevated tenfold. You can feel the amount of pure passion and love that Denis Villeneuve and the entire crew poured onto this behemoth of a project. Easily another Oscar sweep for Dune, this time it'll most likely win Best Picture because I can't fathom another film getting this close to perfection ever again or at least in the near future. Visually unexplainably beautiful. If you get the chance you need to watch it in IMAX or just the largest screen and loudest speakers you possibly can. The black and white Feyd-Rautha sequence is edited to unfathomable levels of perfection, hell that's just one of the scenes I can say that for. This movie has at least ten of the most bad-ass shots I've ever seen. Hans Zimmer's score is crafted with his usual mastery and is complimented so greatly by Greig Fraser's visuals in a beautiful tango of sight and sound.The conflicts our characters face are so intriguing and immersive, that we understand what they're going through, the dire decisions they have to make, and what it will cost them. The commentary on faith, purpose, and what is too far? It's so much more than a pretty sci-film movie with cool sounds, there is so much soul and so much to say and it executes every beat it wants to hit without fail. From giant epic battles to deep, personal, emotional, and quiet conversations it all blends as one beautiful portrait that is easily Denis Viellenueves Magnum Opus.The entire cast bodies every roll. Timothee Chalamet is the perfect Paul Atreides he handles his character with such power and gives off this Aura that I haven't seen in a very long time, may be the best character ever written that I've seen. If you don't care about this film at all that's okay, but please watch it to see his performance at least. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is even more menacing than he is in the books and, again, is transformed into a performance I could see getting him another Oscar Nomination. Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica has this presence that I can't even put into words. Zendaya's Chani has this beautiful chemistry with Chalamet's Paul Atreides with an irreplicable story between them so greatly displayed.I LOVED the costume design accompanied by some spectacular lighting that compliments each other in a way I haven't seen anything close to it.This is absolute Sci-Fi perfection. This is tied or even surpasses Empire as the best Sci-Fi film of all time and is the easiest top four I have ever put on this account, and it won't leave that's for sure. Every person who worked on this is a master at their craft and will be remembered throughout history as the people who put together potentially the greatest story ever told. I heard all the praise that this film got and knew after reading the book that it was going to be easily one of my favorites, but nothing could have prepared me for it to be as good as it was. Genuinely cannot think of a complaint. I commented on the first Dune how I wish there was an extended edition, not needed anymore. Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done better. He elevated the emotion and intensity of everything that happens in the novel with numerous additions to the source material while still being perfectly faithful. The only thing that saddens me is that Frank Herbert himself couldn't have watched this, I just know this is exactly what he wanted and what he deserved for his masterpiece of a novel.I can't express what this movie means to me, I'll be rewatching it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I've thrown around the phrase ""This is my Empire Strikes Back"" a few times like when I watched Endgame for example, but this is truly the only film that is deserving of that phrase. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to see it all unfold in IMAX with a packed theater of pure Dune fans. It felt like home.LONG LIVE CINEMA.SPOILERS:
..
..
THEY GAVE GURNEY HIS BALISET!!!!! I genuinely got so excited that he got his few seconds with it. Denis' adaptation is so faithful to the source material while still having some insane creative liberties that for the first time (outside of his first Dune) just increases the quality.I LOVED what he did with Princess Irulan where we got to see her actually record the excerpts we read at the beginning of every chapter, such a great detail that lets us dive deeper into her character that barely makes an appearance in the actual book. Actually, Denis Villeneuve does a wonderful job of extending the appearances of all these characters that weren't in the novel in the first place. We get so much Rabban which makes me so happy, I was wishing we had gotten more of him in the first film because he's a pretty important character who we don't see much action from already in the book. So us being able to see him at his fullest during this was great. I can't even begin to talk about Feyd-Rautha... what a character, his presence is only matched by Muad'dib himself (who I will get to shortly). He's so menacing and evil... I love him. Getting to see him just slash people for simply questioning him was awesome and I'm so glad we got to see even more parallels between him and Muad'dib especially the added Gom Jabbar that I don't recall being a part of the novel, hell 90% of his scenes weren't in the novel but are all so in character and perfectly done that it's as if it was all a part of the original writing.Paul Atreides, Muad'dib, Usul, Kwisatz Harderach, Lisanal whatever you want to call him is easily one of the best characters ever put onto screen. I've said it already a few times, but the AURA that Chalamet brings to this character is something I can't put into words and is something that needs to be experienced. The shift in his character as we see him slowly accept his terrible purpose is so brilliantly displayed. The expressions in his eyes, the way he presents himself, all of it changes ever so slightly as we see him being The One. I remember after reading the book I revisited Dune 2021 and was lost on why they left out the revelation that the Baron is Lady Jessica's Father/ Paul's Grandfather. I remember thinking that this movie was gonna be half flashbacks because of scenarios like that and was slightly worried. I will never put an ounce of doubt on Villeneuve ever again. The way that it's revealed is so well done that it was another one of those moments where you'd think that it was written like that originally. Paul's conflict is so well displayed I loved seeing the really dark undertones that he was showing as the film progressed realizing that this war is a necessary thing to happen and no matter what that throne has to be taken. It's exactly what Frank Herbert would have wanted after he had to make an entire second book just because everyone thought Paul was a perfect hero, Denis handled that misconception perfectly and I can't wait for Dune Messiah (God please let it be greenlit) to see him fully handle the aftermath. That means I'm going to be reading Dune Messiah ASAP.I thought the choice of Alia not being born and no real mention of Leto II was very interesting but definitely didn't take anything away from the film. It definitely would be weird and difficult to have a four-year-old act like an all-knowing Bene Gesserit woman. I love how it also allowed for the chance of Paul killing the Baron himself which in my opinion was much more satisfying than Alia doing it. Speaking of satisfying death I loved how Gurney was the one who was able to kill Rabban after he mentioned that he killed his family as well as gave him the scar on his face much much more satisfying. Lady Jessica talking to Alia with her still in the womb I thought was really cool and perfectly displayed the connection the Bene Gesserit have with each other as well as a cool nod to the mother-daughter bond.Every battle (especially the final one) has so much raw emotion and strength with this scale that cannot be matched. I was grinning from ear to ear so much that I wish I had a camera set on me throughout the whole thing. The Atreides banner being waved on top of sandworms is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The Feyd-Rautha birthday gladiator fight is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The final battle between Muad'dib and Feyd-Rautha is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The world-building as we dive further into Arrakis and Giedi Prime is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The conflicts between Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Atreides, Harkonnen, Sardaukar, and Guild, is one of the coolest things I'll ever see.I could type for years, but I need to just let this soak for a bit, I'll be writing more with every watch of this I have.",positive
643,"After a first movie I enjoyed so much, I expected nothing less that the same quality, mystery and action. It's been disappointing that I found an interesting movie I like but nothing else and far from the overall impression I got from the first one, specially the extrange lack of the powers that Paul just should have developed after drinking the water off life that is a key moment but not in the movie. Clearly it is necessary at least a 3rd movie.The deaths of the Harkonen also are treated in the movie as absolute lateral and, pum! Fast and easy, too easy for my taste.It also shows too many moments the vision of the war... the dialogue with the sister, no comment, and absence of the guild, mentats and so on...",positive
644,"What do I not understand about this movie?Now that I have seen it, and see both user shares here (mostly with Masterpiece as the title) and in various professional reviews praising and praising this film. I count on many ""not useful"" after publishing what I now have in mind, but stand well in it; I don't think this movie is particularly good.Dune part 1 was, for me, a promising start (although I prefer movies to have an ending). Rarely have I been more disappointed than when I finally got to see Dune Part 2. I'll explain:The 1 was the prelude, I thought. Unlike David Lynch's 1984 Dune, director Denis Villeneuve used Part 2 to establish the story, the characters. I could then forgive that, in that film too, I thought the whole thing was slow, and partly boring. (although the Dune part 1 film was also beautifully shot). I thought that Part 2 would offer more action-oriented, exciting action than it largely does.Part 2 continues in the same vein as the first film; endless dialogues, a slow love story that never quite convinces, endless scenes (beautiful yes) of sand/desert scenery. A long period where endless time and scenes are spent on the main character's ""inner struggle"" about what he should become and do.When the film finally has some punch, the showdown between Paul Atreides and House Harkonnen and the Emperor remains incredibly tame and unexciting. One fight scene, and then it's all over.Timoth√©e Chalamet is a shooting star and a skilled actor. But he doesn't convince me in this movie. I don't think he's suited to be a tough leader in a grand sci fi adventure like this is supposed to be. For me in this role. I actually don't think he fits this role. So this was jarring for me as well.A bunch of the best actors we have today are on the cast list. Of little help to me. The scenes with the worms are only marginally better made than in the 1984 version. Is it not possible to achieve something better with today's technology?I read that the third Dune movie is in the works. I'm not going to spend money on watching it. Maybe when it comes on a streaming service I have. Otherwise, I'm done.",positive
645,"It's up to the people who love good movies to get out to the theaters when they make a movie like this. I grew up watching Dune on tv at least a dozen times. I think it did more with less, but this movie is on all fronts much better and deserves my highest rating. It wasn't perfect but when you spend almost 3 hours in a theater and never once want to leave your seat... We had 9 people in our group and everyone loved it so that is another reason for the 10/10. Ages 13-57 male and female. I've never read the books so I can't critique from that point of view, but after watching part 2 now I want to order the books and hopefully refrain from reading the last one until after part 3 is released.",positive
646,I think I'll have to watch this again to decide if it's the best movie but I can say it's way better than the first movieI have read the book and it is very close to being like it apart from Usul (Paul) had a sister in the book and she killed the baron Vladimir harkonnen whereas in the movie she wasn't even born.Feyd Rautha vs Paul was amazing but I really would have liked it to go on for just a bit longerThe scene with the 3 sandworms and the fremen riding them was amazing and when Paul called the grandfather sandworm Shai-Hulud I got really interested although I already was.I did feel like the emperor maybe could have had some more screen time but I also think he had enough and Paul and Princess Irulan will now rule the galaxy together.Very excited for dune messiah aswell.,positive
647,"Visually stunning. Music is great. But the story is a bit rush at the last part. If it is a 3 part movie, it might be better to cover all the details and push the story to the climate. If you haven't watch part 1, watch it before watch part 2. If you like part 1, sure you will like part 2. Is not a traditional style of action of fantasy movie, is more like a cautionary tales that reflect real world religious and politics. Never the less, I would give it a 10 out of 10. Is a must watch movie in cinema, you won't get and same level of visual and audio effect at home. I recommend to watch the IMAX format.",positive
648,"Great movie!I missed only Count Fenring thread. It was one of the best parts of the books for me.Battles in the sand are looking super cool in cinema. This entire movie will loose a lot in home tv without good sound and big screen so I recommend not to wait and run to cinema now.Plot itself is well executed. They didnt portrayed it in black-white fashion with good Paul and evil emperor. Paul can be seen as changing gaining self-confidence and power but loosing his human side. Which is great. Perfect characters are for marvel. Here we have evil(or not?) emperor who keep galaxy peaceful but do a lot of dirty deeds to keep it in good shape.And on the other side our hero who will bring war and destruction to entire universe. But he is a good guy for us - because he looks well and we follow him for two movie as the main protagonist.He is using religion, naivety and brainwashing of Bene Geserits to gain control in empire. Who will oppose will be killed.",positive
649,"Not only was the film gorgeous, music amazing and acting phenomenal, but they actually stayed pretty true to the book. There were a few variations which I understand why they did (ex- adding in child actors would be difficult) but was still a little sad about. Otherwise, the plot very closely followed the original. For those who didn't read the book, it's still a great story and very enjoyable film. The CGI was well done and the costumes made it feel very authentic. I see why Hans Zimmer wanted to do this movie. He slightly deviated from his usual instruments and made a phenomenal soundtrack. I'd definitely recommend watching!",positive
650,"Brilliant!!! Epic!!! Visually Stunning!!! A treat for the senses!!!! A Cinematic masterpiece. Sets the Bar for Science Fiction movies. A truly immersive experience that transports you for nearly 3 hours to another world. ""A"" Listers brought their ""A"" game!!! Testosterone and Estrogen oozed off the screen. Battle scenes and hand to hand combat to rival anything that came before it. Truly a creative spectacle to behold. No disappointments here. Incredible cinematography, world building, costume design, score, editing and acting, makes this not only the best sci/fi film of the year but probably of the decade. Will for sure be Nominated for several Oscar's, and will be considered one of the greatest of all time.",positive
651,"This film was stunning in its visual and audio presentation. Full of grandiose scenes and drama. But Dune is a complicated human drama, not an action story. And there is a tremendous amount of talent in this well cast tale. But that talent, and the story, is wasted on a script devoid of story telling.The best scene in the entire pair of films is near the end, when Muad Dib declares himself Duke of Arakis. Finally, a great actor gets to act. There should have been so much more of this.If Villanueva had taken the script from the SciFi mini series, with this terrific cast and his amazing visuals, he would have created a masterpiece. Instead, scene after scene of grand visuals and moody characters just became tedious.And I just have to add, Emperor Shaddam was terribly miscast. I almost laughed out loud in the theatre. Charismatic, brilliant and ruthless, not a creepy and disturb psychopath, LOL.",positive
652,"This film is visual poetry, you just have to see to appreciate. You just never one it to end sound is something people my take for granted in a film or maybe not think about but from the sound track to the explanations and the deadly environment around you it just felt so real, I loved the seriousnsss of this movie it was do or die and left you fully emursed. All the new characters were brilliant the development of the story is fantastic couldn't have asked for more other than being gready and wanting more, if I had to pick something negative maybe the big fight seen could have done with an extra 15 minutes to be more detailed and should the real strategy involved but honestly probably just me wanting more. Beautiful!",positive
653,"Here it comes Dune Part Two with the most rewarding ending since The Silence of the Lambs.I have seen thousands of movies in my lifetime but Dune Part Two stands out for its commitment to cinema itself.A superb job by team Villeneuve including Fraser for cinematography, Walker for editing and Zimmer for scoring.I rarely have these kind of emotions but Dune Part Two has been highly rewarding thanks to Frank Herbert's novel of 1965.There is no doubt that director Denis Villeneuve did his homework in order to bring a book of generation to the big screen.This is filmmaking at its finest. Chamalet and Zendaya nail it with all the supporting cast.It just a joy to watch DUNE completely.",neutral
654,"Nice atmosphere. Mortuary, but somehow nice as a working product. Always tragic and godly music but nothing happens. Or too little. Too much tension for nothing. Slow moves. Clasic hero looks for too many characters.Nice acting from the big actors (those 4) and Zendaya. The rest were destroyed by copy - paste recipe ( I'm sure they can do more).So, basically, same as the first one. But further on the story line. Just a mm further.Imagine a great set, great sound (too much maybe), but not much to see, just drama and drama again. With no support in story, just for coolness.A big loss for me.",positive
655,"Dune Part 2, continues the story of Paul and his mom as they live on after his family's dissemination. Acclimating with the Desert people, he continues his path to acceptance and revenge whilst her mom, is pushed for deity-ship as the new reverend mother.Its biggest strength is that it is a visual feast. Every moment is a painting vibe. Deneuve knows how to frame his shot and elegantly present it to the audience.Personally, not my film though. Its a bit dense for a Dune normie like me. This truly felt like you actually need to watch Dune Part One again and relearn stuff. AND, I hated that this film was written to be more of an actual 2hr 45min interlude to the third film. It was not a film that can stand on its own EVEN with the knowledge you had if you watched the first part.I also felt that this came off intensely slow (not well paced) and overlong. The action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end AND its barely a climax in fact. A lot of the characters in this film are fodder (ie Butler and Pugh) and could have been edited out of it, and it would still make sense. Butler is definitely overhyped for how little/barebone his role is. Zendaya and Chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten - that's a testament given how long the film feels. The religious cult storyline faired better but I felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the story rather than driven into dialogue.Overall, just not my cup of tea. I think its overhyped.",negative
656,"First off, Dune Part Two does justice to Frank Herbert's visions when he authored the book. The complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings, and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so.Focusing less on comparisons around the book, Dune Part Two feels unique to the first movie. Regarding their similarities of how Part Two upscales everything that Part One did right (and removed EVERY criticism I had with it), the pacing of Dune Part Two is crafted excellently.Each arc in the story is written and filmed like a Greek Epic, with Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet being your Heracles. Simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss.I especially was a fan of Austin Butler's performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times, when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to Feyd's psychotic tendencies.Chalamet stepping up as a leader in his Hero's Journey is a transcendent experience, as he quickly transforms from bland, intelligent, and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind. Overall, Paul Atreidus becomes an actually interesting character.This movie had some unintentional comedic moments. The Fremen's reaction to anything that Paul did made my near-entire theater laugh three times.Already, this review is getting very long, but props to Hans Zimmer for creating yet another majestic score for a movie.That's not all I have to say, but you get the picture.",positive
657,"""Dune Part Two"" is not just a film; it's an immersive journey that envelops you in its vast, mesmerizing universe. As a fan of the first installment, I eagerly anticipated this sequel, and it exceeded all expectations. Denis Villeneuve's direction brings Frank Herbert's world to life with such depth and authenticity that you feel transported to the sands of Arrakis yourself. What struck me most was the perfect balance of CGI usage. While the film relies heavily on visual effects to portray its otherworldly landscapes and creatures, it never feels overdone or artificial. Instead, the CGI enhances the storytelling, seamlessly blending with practical effects to create a believable and awe-inspiring world. From the towering sandworms to the intricate architecture of the Fremen sietches, every detail feels meticulously crafted, drawing you further into the narrative. It's a testament to the filmmakers' skill that even in the most visually stunning sequences, the focus remains on the characters and their emotional journey. As I watched ""Dune Part Two,"" I found myself completely immersed in its world, captivated by its beauty and complexity. It's a rare feat for a film to strike such a perfect balance between spectacle and substance, and for that, it deserves all the praise it receives. In my eyes, ""Dune Part Two"" is not just a sequel; it's a cinematic masterpiece.",neutral
658,Best film I have ever seen simple. The plot behind this story from both films are truly astonishing. The most beautiful part though is how Denis Villeneuve brings this movie to life it was his dream project and you can truly see that in the way made this film it's just so good the little attention to details and Paul fulfilling his destiny. Then becoming the man he was meant to be compared to the boy in this fist film.Hans Zimmer. I mean wow I have no words I am speechless the music behind this film is hand down his best ever work you really feel immersed in to the story. You really feel like this movie is set in a different universe.,positive
659,"A really accurate representation of the book. Although there are some changed elements, still an amazing film. The portrayal of the Harkonnens is breathtaking, the music and the effects are exhiliraring and the lead actors play impeccably well, especially Timothy. Seeing as movies today often do not tell the whole story as it should be told, I would say that this film almost perfectly envisions how a book adaptation should be made. Moreover, the visual effects are stunning, the sandworms are depicted perfectly and the use of more practical effects over CGI is something that today's cinema lacks, which this films executes perfectly.",positive
660,"Drove 300km to watch this movie on IMAX, it was totally worth it. Get to the biggest screen possible.You would be mesmerized by the visuals and music and would just sit back and let them wash over you. Alongside you have brilliant cast who give their best.I wish Feud-Reutha, the emporer and his daughter characters are more fleshed out. Denis shows why he is one of the best directors of our generation, his world building if flawless and he was true to the books with very minor deviations.I hope everyone catches this on big screen, we dont get pure artistic movies like this made with such passion.",positive
661,"Ah Zendaya...just not right for this. Not her fault though that the writers chose to have her be mad at The Messiah for most of the movie. Knife fight climax nothing new...boring actually. Rabban is actually a coward now? Uh...ok...Not enough worm action. We get it, the Ben Geserrit folks don't care what side they are on. Teased Anya Taylor Joy but have to save her for the Part 3 money grab...Music may fit, but it's all retread from Gladiator and every other sci fi movie of the last 20 years. (Wailing middle Eastern sounding woman/large bass blasts at the beginning of wide shots...That's the bad. Here's the good:Special FX and set design are pitch perfect. Lighting and cinematography are masterful. Bardem wins the audience over, and Rebecca Ferguson is on her game. The build up to Paul becoming the messiah is very well done, and Chalamet pulls it off.People comparing this to Empire Strikes Back are paid by the studios to write reviews. This movie IS worth watching and is certainly entertaining though. With better casting and a climax that did not feel so rushed, could have been epic.",positive
662,"Director Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune Part 2"" picks up the narrative threads seamlessly from where its predecessor left off, delivering another visually stunning and emotionally resonant chapter in Frank Herbert's legendary saga.From the mesmerizing landscapes of Arrakis to the intricate political webs woven among its inhabitants, Villeneuve masterfully captures the essence of Herbert's richly imagined universe. The film's visuals, once again, are nothing short of breathtaking, with sweeping desert vistas and intricately designed spacecraft that transport viewers to the heart of this expansive world.Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides continues to impress, as he navigates the treacherous waters of power and destiny with a maturity beyond his years. His chemistry with Rebecca Ferguson, who shines once again as the fierce and enigmatic Lady Jessica, adds depth to their complex mother-son relationship.Newcomers to the cast, including Zendaya as the mysterious Fremen warrior Chani, and Javier Bardem as the charismatic Stilgar, breathe life into their respective roles, bringing a fresh energy to the ensemble.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance grand spectacle with intimate character moments. While the epic scale of the story is undeniably awe-inspiring, it is the human drama at its core that truly resonates. Themes of identity, loyalty, and sacrifice are explored with nuance and depth, inviting audiences to ponder the complexities of power and the nature of destiny.Hans Zimmer's haunting score once again elevates the film, perfectly complementing the grandeur and emotion of the narrative. His use of leitmotifs and sonic textures adds layers of meaning to each scene, immersing viewers in the world of Dune in ways both subtle and profound.The second installment of Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" saga not only builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor but also delves deeper into the intricate politics and ideologies that shape the universe of Arrakis. As the power struggles between the noble houses intensify and the specter of war looms ever larger, the film navigates the murky waters of ambition and betrayal with deft precision.One of the film's most striking aspects is its attention to detail, both in its world-building and character development. From the intricacies of Fremen culture to the Machiavellian machinations of the various factions vying for control of Arrakis, every aspect of Herbert's universe is brought to vivid life on the screen. Each character, no matter how minor, feels fully realized, with their own motivations and desires driving the narrative forward.The cinematography, once again, deserves special mention for its ability to capture the otherworldly beauty of Arrakis while also conveying the harsh realities of life on the desert planet. From the towering sand dunes to the windswept sietches of the Fremen, every frame is a visual feast for the eyes, immersing viewers in a world that is at once alien and familiar.At the heart of the film lies the character of Paul Atreides, whose journey from reluctant heir to messianic figure is at once epic and deeply personal. Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the internal struggle and external pressures that define Paul's transformation with remarkable nuance and subtlety.The supporting cast, too, deserves praise for their performances, with each actor bringing their own unique talents to their respective roles. From Oscar Isaac's stoic portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides to Jason Momoa's charismatic turn as Duncan Idaho, every member of the ensemble contributes to the film's success, adding layers of complexity to an already rich tapestry of characters.Of course, no discussion of ""Dune Part 2"" would be complete without mentioning the film's thematic depth. At its core, ""Dune"" is a story about power - who wields it, who seeks it, and who ultimately pays the price for its pursuit. Through its exploration of themes such as colonialism, environmentalism, and the nature of prophecy, the film invites audiences to reflect on the timeless questions of ethics and morality that lie at the heart of human existence.In conclusion, ""Dune Part 2"" is a triumph of both storytelling and spectacle, a rare cinematic experience that manages to be both epic in scope and intimate in its emotional resonance. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, while also challenging us to confront the truths that lie at the heart of our own humanity.",positive
663,"I'm not going to give a long protracted review instead its a great movie, great special effects which is why I gave it 7 stars but such a poor ending not sure why Alia has not bee born yet and the fact that they completely mess up the death of the Harkonnen Duke who I did not think was menacing in either film I much preferred the Duke in the original.1984 film.Also Chani and Paul have a son who has just been killed in the book and Chani completely understands that the marriage to the Emperors daughter is a political marriage yet the movie has her walking away from Paul I think this dilutes the binding relationship between the two characters which is so strong in the book.I reread the first book of Dune just to make sure I was not missing the plot and then realised that it was the writers and director of this movie that missing the plot at the end such a shame.",positive
664,"I fell asleep from boredom while watching the first part of the movie. Yesterday, gave it another chance and watched it again and fell asleep again.I saw many positive feedbacks about the 2nd part, and wanted to give it a try. It's slightly better than the 1st part but still kept me bored for 3 hours.If you compare the whole remade movie with the original one many important details were omitted and replaced with unnecessary sobbings. The remake doesn't tell how the story origins and why emperor decided to get rid of the House of Artreids, who gave him a hint to kill the whole house members.",positive
665,"This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!This movie take the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!!Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking!I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find!

666,"The visuals through the entire film were stunning , the characters development was masterful and the casting couldn't be more perfect with 10/10 performances from all of them . The best sci-fi film I've ever seen without a Shadow of a doubt. The cinematic genius from Denis allows for a vast understanding of the planet . The introduction of the emperor and the five house perfectly sets up the next film which I'm sure will be action packed and will further develop Paul and his mother's character along with the introduction of his sister who will certainly be an extremely impactful character . Truly the perfect movie.",positive
667,"Usually when you watch something like this, you can't help that small part of you that wants to be a critic. You think, the book was better, or I don't like how they adapted that. Not with this movie, it's strong, powerful, every scene stands on its own, has purpose and expands the story. Character introduction is strong, acting amazing and powerful, the music score almost makes you want to cry, sound effects amazing and the graphics are just next level.If you love a good story, even if you don't love sci-fi, you are probably going to love this movie. And if you are a sci-fi lover, this is the movie you have been waiting for. It leaves part 1 in the ashes.",positive

It's violent, it's very dark, don't let your kids watch it if you got common sense. The huge dark Islamic influence made me feel very uneasy, it makes it a sci-fi thriller for me, verging on horror. Very sinister and sadistic and demonic, very dark indeed. But it is movie making cinema brilliance, quite Amazing. It's for that reason I will probably take myself to this cinema experience a second time. The Big Cinema Experiences seem few and far between these days, so I make the most of them. 10/10.",positive
669,"Dennis Villeneuve is a filmmaker with a very singular vision. He has made some of the best sc-fi movies of the last decade and Dune Part Two is no exception.I've now seen the movie in IMAX and 70mm film respectively.From a technical standpoint this film is a masterclass in cinematography and visual storytelling.Every actor does their absolute best to portray fully fleshed out characters. Stand outs in the movie are Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler and Zendaya.This is truly a space epic for the ages and I can confidently say that Dennis Villeneuve will enter the upper echelon of masterful directors.Thank you.",positive

The transformation of the characters and political conflicts as well as the music and visual production are terrifying and great.As you continue this part, your appreciation for the character of Leto Atreides will increase.

671,"So Villeneuve is my favorite current-working director, and when I saw all the great ratings and reviews for this movie, I was excited about it thinking it must have improved on everything that was wrong with the first Dune movie. But unfortunately, the only thing that improved here was the visuals and the action, and they were fine even in the first movie too.I rewatched the first Dune again before watching this because I didn't remember much from the first time I watched it 3 years ago. And I think I understood the story of the first movie better this time, but my overall enjoyment of the first movie and feelings about it were the exact same; it's a decent introduction to this universe and characters, but lacks the needed emotional connection of the viewer with the characters, and the characterization needs a lot of work. (And obviously, the story suddenly ending)
When I reviewed the first movie, I said hopefully a second movie would be made to complete the story and give a better characterization to these characters. But sadly, this movie continued with the same shallow characterization problem as the first film.These movies aren't short either, they are nearly 3 hours, so they have all the time in the world to make you care about these characters and flesh them out. But most of the time is spent on ""cool"" visuals and action scenes. And don't get me wrong, the visuals are amazing, absolutely 10/10 visuals and cinematography. But the storytelling and characterization here is 6/10 or 7/10 at best. So how can a movie be a ""masterpiece"" if only the visuals are good but the story is lacking?Many people compare these movies to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and that actually highlights the problems of this movie and also reinforces what a miracle it was that the LOTR trilogy turned out the way it was and no one has been able to reproduce the magic of those movies, not even Peter Jackson himself.Comparing Dune to LOTR, you'll realize how much thought and work had gone into making LOTR and its characters relatable, easily making the audience familiar with these characters, and allowing them to form a great emotional connection to them. LOTR was written as an adaptation that the book-readers can enjoy, and the audience who hadn't read the books could also watch and still get the story and understand the characters and their motivations. You don't need to read the books to understand every character in the movie and why they did what they did, or having to read to make an emotional connection to them. The films already did those things masterfully.But Dune? It definitely is a movie that's made for people who are already familiar with the universe and have already read the books. It's like a summary with cool action montages of the important plot points that leaves out the character-building and much-needed parts to make the audience understand the character arc of Paul Atreides.Attack on Titan did that with Eren Yeager and you could understand the transformation of this protagonist throughout the story. But in this movie, Paul just changes suddenly toward the end of the movie and the movie does a poor job of justifying that. Instead of giving more time to flesh out this plot point and show what happened and show a gradual change in Paul, we are mostly shown cool visual effects and unimportant scenes with the villains that do nothing to help these antagonists become more than cartoonishly evil one-dimensional characters.And I understand that Attack on Titan is a long anime/manga and definitely had a lot more time to make you care about its characters compared to two movies that are only over 2 hours. And I also understand that Dune is apparently a really difficult book to adapt to a visual medium, and that it's a miracle these two movies even turned out as decent as they did. But like I said, LOTR already proved that you can have the cool visuals, but also have the depth, good storytelling, and great characterization in your movie too.Denis Villeneuve has said that he made Dune for himself, fulfilling his childhood wish. And as nice of a sentiment that sounds, that is the problem with Dune. It's made for himself and those who already know this story. It's not made for someone who wants to get to know this world and characters for the first time via the movies.And like I said, it's not only the protagonists that suffer from a lack of good characterization so the audience can have an emotional connection to them. The villains even lack more. The introduction of Feyd-Rautha and the gladiator arena scene are definitely some of the most unique and iconic scenes in any movie I've ever seen. It shows you that ""yeah, this guy doesn't eff around and is different"" very well. But what happens after that? He just becomes another ""bad guy who eats an apple with a knife and randomly kills his own henchmen because they said hello to him"". Not to mention they don't show what he does differently than Rabban that makes him better and more dangerous. The only thing he does is shoot missiles at the Fremen, and Baron calls it ""genius""? Really? If it was so easy, why couldn't Rabban do it before? Not to mention how disappointing Baron's character is too. You'd think he's an intimidating and powerful villain when watching the first movie, but you're gonna be unpleasantly disappointed by him in this one.And it is sad because Villeneuve actually knows how to write good ""human"" characters and make the audience have an emotional connection with them. He's not Nolan. He's already shown he knows how to write good characters the audience can relate to with Incendies, Arrival, Prisoners, and many more. So I don't know if it was a deliberate choice or he was restricted from making the movie longer and had to cut a lot of scenes that fleshed out these characters more.So I talked a lot about the negatives and I don't want to repeat myself and only talk about the problems I had with it. I still give the movie a 7 because the visuals and the music are too good to give it lower, but I could even give it a 6 because of the story.So 7/10 is still not bad, but considering the rating and the raving, I expected more.Like I said, the cinematography, the direction for the most part, the music, and the action are all 10/10 here and it's a quality blockbuster that more blockbusters should try to follow, but not the storytelling part though.The movie is enjoyable and I didn't really find it boring, though some scenes could've been cut out or dedicated to better flesh out the story and characters. But it's a decent continuation of the first film.When the movie came out and received all the great reviews and ratings, I kept seeing some people saying they liked the first Dune better and I was really confused about how they could like the first movie more if everyone was saying this one is a masterpiece and better in every way. But after finally watching it myself, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the first Dune more too, and I can't believe I liked this one less. Don't get me wrong, the first Dune also greatly suffers from characterization and better storytelling, but it was still a more coherent story than this film's.Overall, it's not a bad movie, but massively disappointed me, especially after seeing the great ratings and reviews it received. It's a movie that's mainly made for the people who've already read the books and know these characters, and they can enjoy these movies more than your average movie-watcher who isn't familiar with this story and characters. I have the same emotional connection to these characters as I did before knowing them for the first time. 10/10 visuals and action, 6/10 storytelling and characterization.",positive
672,"Saw at a Regal RPX, and after I was told they only sell the popcorn buckets at AMC, I had new time on my hands so actually went in.Glad I did! Had that holy smokes how are they doing this feeling I haven't had since I was 13 watching Jurassic Park in the theatre. It's been 25 years since they have been able to show some really new exciting aspects of film making, this creativity is just wow.Not the 13yo feelings I thought I was getting into tonight but still just left the theatre sweaty, excited and in a relaxed state of euphoria. Also can't wait to go back for round 2 immediately.Go see this on the biggest screen you can.",neutral
673,"Excellent visuals, great cast and very close to the book. That's something already rare in today's movies... but not enough for me to shout at a miracle. The defect of the movie is the pace: slow and self indulgent, at least 20-30 minutes longer than needed. Another weak point from my perspective is the almost completely absence of meaningful dialogues and epic lines. I always felt a movie that doesn't have at least 3 to 5 lines to be recalled as soon as you're out of the theater, it's not a great movie. That said, the experience was pleasant even if long and the photography is more enjoyable on big screen.",positive
674,"Sometimes you are full of anticipation and when the moment is there..... you can only be disappointed. The movie is beautifully shot and de pace in most scenes is comfortable besides the action scenes, they are too fast and have no sustenance, so you are basically watching some kicking and slapping but have no idea why.The thing that really irritated me was the lack of story and lack of chemistry between the main couple. Chalamet can act, Zendaya knows about 2-3 facial expressions, the Harkonen are just weird and the worms are, surprisingly, the stars of the show. I wish they gave the story and the cast just as must love and attention, then the movie would be at least satisfying.Instead, this overly hyped movie is just as bad as the last avatar in which the whale-like being had more to tell then the rest of the cast.",positive
675,"Do yourselves a favour and go see it now. I was so enthralled by the first part that as soon as I stepped out of the theater, I ordered the original 6 books. I was so surprised to find that it was not an ordinary sci-fi novel, but that it was a beautiful blend of religion, philosophy, politics and history. Part two does justice to the first book and the adaptations, such as Alia not being born yet, didn't bother me at all. I understand it would have been an impossible task to find a child actor for the part. The cinematography and the music were, again, simply outstanding. As was Timothee Chalamet. The speech he gave in front of the fremen leaders gave me the goosebumps. All in all, it's the best movie I've seen in a good while.",positive
676,"There's not a lot you can pick apart in this movie. Pacing, progression, action, romance (well what romance there is in it), the way it was shot and the way Hans Zimmer works his magic as per usual. I wish I had read the books before viewing as the world building is so fascinating. I love that the world is sci-fi and includes the Fremen society as well. Which is very middle eastern based and include djinn and shamans. The combination of the two was such a wonderful idea that Dune novelist Frank Herbert had and I am thankful that he created this world for us to enjoy. Timothy does a great job as Paul and Zendaya as Chani. Austin Butler though, I was super pleased to hear him not sound like Elvis. He really played this character brutally and it was so necessary. Stellan Skarsgaard is incredible as you would expect and I could also picture Gary Oldman in the role as the baron as well (Just a side note). I would highly recommend watching this right after re-watching the first and enjoy it. I hope they build more on this universe. But please don't oversaturate it, am I right?",positive
677,"Dune 2 is a cinematic masterpiece that will transport you to the spice flowing desert planet of Arrakis and more from the first shot, to the last. The world building feel so natural and intuitive. We get to spend a lot of silent and intimate moments in between moments with all the characters because of which the big moments feel like they were earned not given. The dialogues are simple regarding the religious themes and ideas of the Fremen culture so if you listen and follow carefully it will all make sense. Every single department of Dune 2 has given us, the cinema fans and the film industry ""a masterclass in filmmaking"".Dune: Part Two is a 2 hour and 46 minutes of cinematic masterclass.",neutral
678,"I rarely ever write reviews but I felt I had to after watching this film.I'm a massive fan of the first film (probably my favorite behind Into the spider-verse and maybe Interstellar) and Denis is by far my favorite director, so my expectations were basically in Earth's orbit and it still managed to surpass them.I have never read the 1965 book as I wanted to wait for this film before i read it, so I had no idea what i was in store for but I loved it and this was probably the best cinema experience I've ever had, especially since i got to watch it a day early in the biggest screen at the cinema I work at all by myself.The acting is great (especially Austin Butler), the cinematography is again fantastic, the visuals are mesmerising, the score by Zimmer is amazing etc I could go on but you get the idea. Go watch this film.And now I shall hibernate while i wait for Dune Messiah.",positive
679,"Dune Part 2 delivers a sandstorm of epic proportions, continuing the journey of Paul Atreides in a visually stunning and thrilling sequel. The desert landscapes are breathtaking, the sandworms are terrifyingly majestic and unlike other recent blockbusters, humour is subtly woven into the narrative.Although there were the necessary details book omitted, from the process of crafting something from a page onto a screen, it didn't feel like it was missing any character depth, especially from the key players.As the Bene Gesserit saying goes, ""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer."" and Director Denis Villeneuve wasn't afraid of taking on this second half of this story. He masterfully crafts a world that is both familiar and alien, drawing viewers deeper into the intricate web of politics, power and prophecy. Dune Part 2 is a mesmerizing cinematic experience that will leave you eagerly anticipating the next instalment.",neutral
680,"Okay listen I go to a lot of movies and I'm not an easy person to convince a movies is actually good, but holy this movie. I knew before I went with a friend of mine it had good rumours but actually watching it was something else. The sound effects just everything including the story it was all so fine. Really if you haven't watched it yet in the cinema, go as soon as possible! Part 1 is a must watch before you go to part 2, it pretty much educates you within the dune lore and is very helpful to understand the world they're in. Honestly if I would say I'm not excited for part 3 I'm lying, they shouldn't rush tho but I can't wait!",positive
681,"Great movie, but not a masterpiece for me!Having loved Dune part 1, went in with high hopes but the movie was a bit slow for my liking. The last act was a bit of a mess with a lot of plot holes and the last fight was underwhelming.Overall it felt like the movie was the same quality as the first one but with a few misses right at the end. The scenes are amazing and epic, the setting is great and there could have been a bit more humour.Great acting all around from the stars (as you expect from the heavy hitters) and great to see Timothy mature up in his acting. Austin butler was a standout.",positive
682,"As a fan of syfy and basically read Herbert's books and his sons prequels and continued stories of Dune. This 2nd film far exceeded my imagination!! Granted the original Lynch film is STILL a cult for Dune. This adaptation is noted as grand, well written script, beautifully done cinematography; also the development of dialogue construction is sheer perfection and adding performance of the actors. How does a underdog become the hero and messiah of a planet? By going deep into character and emotion;in other words having the viewer believe they are the messiah and understanding the flaws, the soulful depth and pain of that character!! This film is now the mark the epilogue of cinematic excellence. I was truly happy to sit through the shifting of this magnificent version of Dune.",positive
683,"Not as good as the first movie, feels a bit rushed in the last chapter. Delivers like it's predecessor with an amazing sound and visuals which are one of the best in the business. But the writing and acting do matter more to me and in the end that's what's makes it a little bit worse than previous movie. Dennis is great director, but don't have your judgement clouded by 10/10 reviews which are overblown and overhyped like in every other holywood movie. This movie keeps your attention and sometimes it makes you think about how life on Arrakis is nearly impossible. Watch it but do not expect to get blown away.",positive
684,"What in the actual hll??!. What is with the 10 star reviews? This is far from a perfect movie. All they had to do was stay true to a story that has already been masterfully written and they would have had a great movie. Instead we got this dribble. Terrible. Why not make this movie and call it something else instead of trying to make it sound like it was based on the book; Sand Pirates, Dumb, Buy Two Tickets For a 5 Hour Movie, Visual Spectacle, Bad Story, anything else but Dune. I was so looking forward to seeing the second half of the book revealed and I was left in the dust. Disgusted by this movie.",positive
685,"The film is incredible.The acting, score, costume design, special effects. Everything about this film is so very well done.I'm a big fan of the book and was curious as to how they were going to tackle or introduce some of the things that happen.I felt like what was delivered in Dune: Part Two was the best adaptation they could have made.There are changes, for sure. But a book like Dune, written the way it was written (with lots of perspective and inner monologue) was never going to 100% translate to the big screen. It's tricky adapting books at the best of times.The limited time a film has to tell a story like Dune also would have led to some of the changes in plot and character development.Overall I think it kept the ideas and themes of the book while telling an incredibly similar, fantastic story with incredible visuals and insane score.10/10 for sure.",positive
686,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had. Most movies nowadays try to wow you with either visuals, action, character development, and seemingly less and less so everyday with a reasonable plot. This movie manages to check off every box. It is hard to pinpoint an actor in it that wasn't superb in their role. The visual effects, especially in IMAX , are stunning and are not simply artistic in nature, but actually work to advance the plot.The film is pieced together so brilliantly with each act seamlessly fitting in with the last. The score by Zimmer is unsurprisingly absolute perfection as well.For the length of the movie it actually feels quite short which is a huge achievement and shows how immersed you become in Villneuve's world.However, I would have liked to see more of Feyd Rautha. They had an epic scene of his in the Harkonnen arena, but not too much else to develop him for his final battle against Paul. I also would have liked to see the Sardaukar put up a little better of a fight. They somehow went from the empires greatest fighters to pretty pathetic. Perhaps this was to show how strong Paul and his forces had become, but it just seemed a bit too easy. Still these are just personal aspects I would have liked to see and are not issues in the movie itself.Overall, an epic movie, and the trilogy is likely to be sitting right alongside The Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars movies when all is said and done.This is a can't miss in IMAX.",positive
687,"Dune 2I enjoyed it immensely!This started continuously from the first movie, and luckily I rewatched the first movie in preparation, I would suggest this is a must! Again the movie was merciless, if you had not read the books you would be lost from the start as no explanation was offered, and perhaps should go home at this point lolPart 2 of the book is about the coming true of the Arakan prophecy of a messiah that will lead the fremen to a ""green paradise"". So it is dark and religiously ""top heavy"", and so was this movie. A brooding dark serious movie with Paul and Jessica struggling with their inner demons for most of the time and tons of set piece Marshall combats. No gags here!Mr Villineuve again achieved the impossible by bringing to life this most complex of novels for the fans and it was really quite brilliant and needs to be watched numerous times.Without undermining the brilliant acting from the cast, Timothee Chalamet was outstanding in his ability to command the screen and convey we were in the presence of a messiah, he was never off the screen and it was deeply moving. The element about Paul being able to see backwards and forwards in time, whilst mentioned was not demonstrated really very effectively. Secondly, we needed more demonstration of the voice in its subtleties.There were several divergences from the book, Paul's integration into the Fremen took 3 years and Alia was born with the memories of her ancestors and excellent with a knife, this seemed to happened over a summer in the movie. Secondly Chani stands by Paul's side throughout even through a political marriage, the movie diverges from this. However Mr Villeneuve condensed the spirit of the book without diluting its impetus and Frank Herbert's intentions were respected.Perhaps more controversial, and of course it's my opinion, there was, unfortunately, to my mind, one glaring problem, there just was no on-screen chemistry between Timothee and Zendaya, it just didn't work, also her acting grated, she seemed to have attended the AB school of acting, using just 2 faces that conveyed petulance, irritation or indeed trapped wind! She just overworked most of it as if it was for TV, we all know, for movie acting ""less is more"", she looked the part, but there just was just no sexual frisson, and the accent was too american, everyone else modified their to be from ""nowhere"" exactly, so she was miscast. I have seen this actress now in Spider-Man, Euphoria and now this, she lacks thespianic skills to convey anything more than the superficial, just no heft! Florence Pugh would have made a better Chani as that lady has the skills when she's humble!I thought Austin Butler was brilliant as the evil nephew, bulked up and without eyebrows, and the teeth, it was a terrific transformation and I love it!The music was amazing throughout as were the worms and battle sequences, the CGI set a new standard in meticulous and seamingless continuity, we were there, we had a parched throat and sand in our faces, I did the sand walk back to the underground lol!This is, of course a must see, and I'm giving it a 9 outta 10, brilliant except for the romantic elements, pathetic, and passionless!",positive
688,"A perfect movie got a perfect sequel, Dune 2 compliments how good the first movie was, and it really is what makes the moviegoing experience incredible. I really loved the character dynamics, the camera work, the suspense, and the creativity of the movie. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat, and definitely one of my best movie theater experiences to date. Everything about this movie was beautiful, and it defines the next generation of sci-fi movies. The movie was such a beautiful work of art, and I'm definitely seeing it again on the big screen again. In the best way, which is IMAX of course.",positive
689,"Part 2 eclipses the first movie and builds on it, setting up what will no doubt be an impressive trilogy.The biggest worry I had about adapting Dune is Paul. Over the course of the story, he changes from a likable kid into something more cosmic and inhuman, and that might be a problem for the audience, since stories usually need a relatable character. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet manages this transition skillfully and believably but it still leaves the audience without their relatable character.Villeneuve seems to have hit on an ideal solution: beef up the role of Chani so that she becomes that relatable character. I can already envision her role in the third movie of the trilogy, which no doubt is already being planned given the huge box office success of this movie.This is a big departure from the books but the third movie is going to have to be more of Villeneuve's invention that the first two were, anyway.",neutral

691,"It wasn't as cool as the original. The worm ridding was too cartoonish.But The lack of the philosophy of the weirding devices that gave tones power to actually obliterate matter.And how Paul eventually didn't need the devices. I think Made the original so much more dramatic and divine. Like the magic of the force in Star Wars.Removing it weakened the story and power of the story. Lessening it dramatically to the point all you're left with is a big CGI screen show.But remakes always seem to lose something.It's still a better dialogue, written and acted version.A little more dragging but most movies these days are getting almost too long.",neutral
692,"I believe I've witnessed something magnificent, and truly, it shouldn't be watched outside of the IMAX format because regardless of what anyone says, this is a modern classic. I'm writing this review somewhat for myself because years later, when I read it again, I want to see how much I elevated this legend and how it managed to close so many things correctly despite its mini flaws.For the past two days, the film hasn't left my mind, and the reason I give it a perfect 10 is this. Whenever I talk about the film, I get excited because I've seen a visual masterpiece. It has incredible cinematography, beyond amazing. Watching the Lisan al Gaib scene where the Fremen walk from a bird's eye view, the scene between Paul and Feyd at the end, the scene where the Fremen accept Paul, the Harkonnen attack in the opening sequence, and many others, you feel that there are very few scenes like these. Greig Fraser is a master at this. Besides that, Hans Zimmer's music, which doesn't mean much when listened to alone but reaches a tremendous dimension with the sound mixing, adds a whole new dimension to the film. It's truly wonderfully designed and fitted, Denis, you're amazing.And the casting is phenomenal. Dave, Timoth‚àö¬©e, Florence, Zendaya, Rebecca, Javier, Josh, Austin, they're all fantastic. I won't describe each one separately, saying 'this scene was superb,' everyone fits their role so well and performs so excellently that the film becomes a recital; there isn't a single scene with amateurish or shallow acting. Besides acting, something that needs to be mentioned is the stunts. The fight choreography was quite good and clear, especially the scene between Feyd and Paul at the end, where the music stops and we watch pure fighting for a few minutes, it was wonderful.Besides the cinematography, casting and harmony, the legendary use and synchronization of music, there are two more reasons why this film excels and why I rate it highly. Firstly, the film is superbly adapted, I won't touch upon this further. Secondly, it's a fantastic critique film.The film critiques every mundane and inherent aspect of human nature. Whether it's the dynastic system, coercion around the secret gene preservation logic, the exploitation of religion, political chaos, inefficient use of resources, and many more points, it hits the bullseye so accurately that it's both overwhelming and not tiring while making you feel it, a tremendous achievement.Now, onto the contentious topic of staying faithful to the books and the polemic of how similar it was... Despite everything, it's said that both Part 1 and Part 2 were quite faithful to the book, and I believe they were. Some details might have been skipped or not exactly replicated in the second film, but for such a meta and philosophical book series, this is extremely normal; if everything were portrayed exactly, it might have been incomprehensible. I won't comment on the film's dynasty and operation right now because as a sequel, it has to complete the script with good motivation and also convey the characters it portrays well; I'm very happy it achieved this.The film had a fitting humor, some scenes were mildly funny and unintentionally successful, which was admirable. Also, I think it will sweep the awards at the Oscars next year; it could win for its amazing costumes, production design, adapted screenplay, and maybe even best picture.It's the peak of cinema that I've ever seen; go to IMAX, you won't regret it. I didn't delve into the details because everyone should watch it for themselves and try to interpret it in their own way; it's that kind of film.""May thy knife chip & shatter."" March 2024.",positive
693,"Sorry about that. But this long long long story was really sometimes too much for me. The story was told to lame. And I felt not surprised in this movie about what will happen. The actors are good. Really I need not to review that. What I was really disappointed of was that very indifferent parts getting to much time in this movie with no impact. If you would skip that you will not miss. That's only my point of view. Means nothing. I was expecting really a very great second part and that was not. And something you will probably laugh about me is, that I think the actors did not eat or drink in the desert.",positive
694,"Mr. Villeneuve must have scored a big payday on this one, but there are clear indications that he relinquished creative control to do so, or to put it in old-fashioned terms, sold his soul. His work, when unhindered, is much more mature, and I can only imagine what he would have served us given free rein.His hand is still detected in the visuals - cinematography, set and costume design. That's what those two stars have purchased. Maybe there should be another half a star for Rebecca Ferguson, the only actor who earned their salary in the film. The remainder of the cast can be summed up as two entitled, spoiled young people acting like entitled, spoiled young people, surrounded by slightly more mature adults who try half heartedly to take it all seriously. You can see, on occasion, a glint in the eye of Josh Brolin or Javier Braden, trying to stifle giggles when Timothy or that funny Z girl scream in rage or brood, but maybe the thought of all the dollars pouring into their bank account helped restrain the mirth.It's easy to get carried away by the splendid graphics, but at heart a good film is characterized by brilliance in acting and storytelling, and this film has neither.Perverting the source material in favour of modern narratives is likewise a major flaw, I wonder how much longer we will have such crimes inflicted upon us. Classics are classics for a reason. It's not a complex reason. It's really simple: a great many people have enjoyed and been inspired by them, so they endure. When you change the source material, it becomes weak or anemic, and dies pretty soon after. By dies, I mean people lose interest in it quickly.Whatever popularity the two part Dune remake is enjoying is due to being the least bad thing out there on the silver screen. That's a very low bar.",positive
695,"First of all, this movie isn't for everyone. It isn't a movie you go to see with your friends expecting action. It also isn't a basic sci-fi movie, it's different. Main theme, in my opinion, is the importance of relegion and politics, and the influence it has on us. The Bene-Gesserit were shown so beautifully in this movie-their role, influence and power they have in Dune universe. Frank Herbert is a genius for his time, and the themes he writes about are relevant, both then and nowdays. This movie is absolutely worthy of every praise it gets. Many might not understand it because they haven't read the book, and that willa affect their opinion of this movie, but i think it's fantastic. Yes, a few thing were changed, not necessarily for the better, but it has to be that way in order for such a complex piece to be understood to the broather audience.The first and second part are so much different (in a good way). The chang that characters go through (Paul, Jessica) are so incredibly shown, and you can clearly see that they are a a completely different person by the end of the second movie.Special praises to Denis Villeneuve, he is a genius
I got goosebumps far too much times throughout this movie because of the music which is absolutely mesmerizing.I really hope there will be a third part, and can't wait to go and see this movie many more tikes in theaters.",positive
696,"Dune 2 Is truly a Masterpiece, I think every frame of the film is so perfect and beautiful you could call this Art not film. And with DolbyAtmos it is truly unforgettable Masterpiece. The story that contains so many plot twists and unlocking so many new possible films and otherthings is something only Dune 2 have, almost all the time during the film i was breathtaken somethimes i was just watching the beautiful Dune scenes with opened jaw and thinking What the hell just happend in the story. I think no film to this day had ever left me in such awe. No film ever has evoked so much emotions in me and left my head so confused but on the other hand so mesmerized to Dune 2.",neutral
697,"I saw this opening weekend in 4DX at Regal Theaters (the theater where the seats move, water sprays in the air, air blasts you, the theater fills with smoke, lightning flashes, etc.) I had a completely amazing experience with the movie. Denis Villeneuve is one of my least favorite directors. I thought Prisoners sucked, Blade Runner sucked, and Arrival sucked. But his vision came to completion with this installment of the Dune series. His first Dune movie, in 2021, was rather bland all-around. This one was filled with action sequences to the brim. I also commend him with his efforts in artistic cinema with the black and white Harkonnen world. Austin Butler was really great, as was Zendaya. There are many flaws in the movie such as where it skips parts of the books or changes them, mechanics of some of the sci-fi elements, and some of the actors' lack of commitment to their roles. But overall, it was a really fun and entertaining movie that impressed me a lot. Riding the 4DX seats while they were riding the sandworms was a blast!",positive
698,"What a masterpiece. This is the new Empire Strikes Back for me. Star Wars has and always will be my favorite franchise, then is The Dark Knight Trilogy. Before watching Dune Part One and Dune Part Two, Middle Earth was my third favorite franchise, now I think Dune is my third favorite duology (hoping franchise in a future). I can't wait for more movies of Dune. The ending was speechless. I need moreeeeee!!!!!! Austin Butler was scary as hell as Feyd the new villain. His portrayal was phenomenal as Elvis. And Timothee Challamet as Paul Artreides, was spectacular. The new Anakin Skywalker (the chosen one) aka Darth Vader. This movie is in my Top 5 favorite film in history. It is epic, intense, sometimes dark. It is like Star Wars. If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to enjoy this film. The fights were epic. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, visual effects, were phenomenal. I've seen it twice in theaters and it's very long but enjoyable, for me the duration of the movie is just 30 minutes. I saw it on IMAX and is a must see on the big screen. Highly recommend this film on IMAX.",neutral
699,"This movie ends the debate right here.Villeneuve is currently the greatest filmmaker in the sci-fi genre on the entire planet.Arrival - Blade Runner 2049 - Dune - Dune Part IIFour back-to-back sci-fi classics.All of them released within a span of only 8 years, it's just unheard of. The man has truly conquered this genre and become its face.Dune Part II takes everything from its already brilliant predecessor and elevates it to a completely new level. It's one of the rare sequels that convincingly surpasses the original.Saying this movie is a ""must-watch"" would be a massive understatement.",positive
700,"A cinematic experience of the highest order. I've been awaiting this film and was hoping that it was worth waiting for. Well it was and I'd go so far as to say it surpasses the first instalment and I really didn't think that would be possible.Everything here is masterfully done, the writing, music, costumes, sets and acting are top notch. Obviously things are moving a lot quicker than they do in the books but it doesn't detract at all from what is one of the best films I've seen in a very long timI cannot wait now for the next instalment, hopefully creating a new trilogy on a par with TLOTR. Well done everyone involved.",positive
701,"The film is amazing on the big screen, the score definitely fits the film, BUT the storyline is very distorted and far from what Frank Herbert wrote. The timeline is not supposed to be within a year, and I fear that the next film will move even further away from Dune the messiah now that the timelines have all been put out of place.The build up to the end was great, but the final battle was over so quickly I was frankly very surprised and extremely disappointed.The book had subtle twists that were left out of the film and therefore the character development is shallow and the love story between Paul and Chani is left wanting.Personally I think Florence would have played a better and stronger Chani.Very disappointed that Alia's birth storyline was completely missed .They have an amazing casting, and thrown a lot of money into making a sorrowful adaptation of a great book.",positive
702,"""Dune: Part 2"" not only surpasses its predecessor but also stands as a cinematic triumph reminiscent of ""Return of the Jedi."" While the first installment provided a rich context and a tantalizing glimpse into the expansive universe of Dune, the second part truly brings the saga to life, delivering the depth, drama, and grandeur fans have eagerly anticipated.From the very first frame, it's evident that ""Dune: Part 2"" is a visual masterpiece. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the vast and intricate landscapes of Arrakis with stunning clarity and beauty. Every scene is meticulously crafted, drawing viewers deeper into the story's rich tapestry. The special effects are equally impressive, seamlessly blending with the narrative to create a fully immersive experience that transports audiences to another world.However, it's the cast that truly elevates this film. ""Dune: Part 2"" is a showcase of exceptional acting talent, with each actor delivering performances that are both powerful and nuanced. The characters we've come to know and love in the first film undergo significant evolution, their arcs handled with care and precision. The growth and development of these characters are epic, making their journeys not only believable but also deeply compelling.One of the most striking aspects of ""Dune: Part 2"" is how it deepens the narrative introduced in the first film. The stakes are higher, the conflicts more intense, and the emotions more raw. It's a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, blending action, intrigue, and emotional depth in a way that few films manage to achieve. The screenplay is tight and well-paced, ensuring that every moment feels vital and engaging.As a fan, I've been waiting for a movie like this for years. ""Dune: Part 2"" is not just a sequel; it's a fulfillment of the promise made by its predecessor. It's a film that not only expands on the world-building of the first part but also delivers the payoff in spectacular fashion. Whether you're a long-time fan of the Dune series or new to this epic saga, ""Dune: Part 2"" is a cinematic journey that you won't want to miss. It's a jewel in modern filmmaking, a testament to what can be achieved when a beloved story is brought to life with passion, skill, and dedication.",positive
703,"Dune Part Two is the sequel to the first Dune film by director Denis Villeneuve, which was released in 2021. Paul Atreides (Timoth√©e Chalamet) has now joined the Fremen group. Here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms. Paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. With Chani (Zendaya) at his side, Paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the Emperor (Christopher Walken). This sequel, three years later, immediately picks up where the first part ended. This first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the Dune story. Previous film adaptations turned out less well, because the story of the Dune books is quite a large and complicated story. With Denis Villeneuve's first part he managed to properly introduce the Dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups. With this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the Fremen group, who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach. Furthermore, the relationship between Paul and Chani is also developed a bit more, but there are some rushed moments. However, with this second part, many things have to be explained and built upon, which means that there are some long-winded moments in this second part. Compared to the first part, this second part has more room for action scenes, which increases the pace and tension slightly. Furthermore, it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses, which fight each other more strategically than really physically. In contrast to the first part, things in this second part feel more rushed. Like the relationship between Paul and Chani. The aspect of the earthworms and how the Fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner, so it is not always clear. Denis Villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the Dune books. Together with photography director Greig Fraser, they ensure that the images appear beautiful, creative and credible. By adapting the Dune story from the first book of the series into two films, Denis Villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation. This also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films. Timoth√©e Chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family. Furthermore, he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance. Compared to the first part, Zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with Timoth√©e Chalamet, his character. However, this relationship can seem a bit rushed, which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer. Of the new cast members, Austin Butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army, but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development. Other well-known actors such as Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken play their roles well and appropriately, but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second Dune film.",positive
704,1. Timoth√©e body is like a skeleton.2. Same old boring story about the good vs evil.3. Everybody is so serious looking in every scene.4. The cast is Hollywood red carpet in one movie.5. lea seydoux as a witch6. Austin 'Elvis' Butler as a bad guy with a offcouse a very low evil voice.7. The movie is almost 3 hour long and its the same things happening the hole time8. Zendaya is VERY serious9. The story telling is very bad. Why is this happening? Who are they?10. The blue Holy water of life is from a worm.One star goes to Hans Zimmer for the music and the Speciel Effects team on the set.,positive
705,"Another exemplary work of art by Denis Villeneuve. Dune Part 2 is absolutely an Epic Cinema just like Dune Part 1.This one only should be experienced in a mammoth IMAX 70 MM Screen with Largest and loudest format.Flawless Visual effects, Such Glorious Cinematography by Greig Fraser, Beautiful production design, The Heart Thumping Astounding Musical score and Sonically Sound design by Hans Zimmer. The background score will stay with you for Days.The 3 Pillars of these two parts Epic Adventure Films are 'Direction', 'Visuals' and 'Background Score'.Story, screenplay, Action sequence are excellent.Denis Villeneuve, Greg Fraser and Hans Zimmer have such mastery towards their work, Direction, Cinematography and Music. What a great Collaboration.Brilliant performance by every actor. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Austin Butler, Stella Skarsgard, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista and last but not the least Christopher Walken were Fantastic.Dune Part 1 and Part 2 will be remembered as most Spectacular Sci-Fi Action, Adventure, War, Drama Films in the history.Waiting for next one from the Novel Dune: Messiah!!!!This movie Deserves 10/10 in all aspects.",positive
706,"I always anticipated that Dune Part Two would surpass the first, a common trend in movies like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. Dune, directed by Denis Villeneuve, impressed me with its authenticity, epic storytelling, cinematography, atmosphere, and overall execution. While not flawless, the performances of the actors and actresses make any mishaps negligible. This rendition stands on its own, and I haven't felt the need to watch the 1984 version.The characters were very interesting. We see the religion, how Paul becomes the next leader, Bardem, I love his character, he speaks with such authenticity and he makes it enjoyable. The duel between Paul vs Feyd in a silent moment with no music was insane. Those were some great moments in the film.",positive
707,"Can a sequel surpass the original? YES IT CAN! ""Dune: Part Two"" delivers in so many ways, making this one of the greatest science fiction films ever. With a runtime of 2 hours and 46 minutes, you can easily see that not a single second was wasted. Sound design was a key factor as it produced such an immersive experience, feeling every single bit of bass in the seats. Visually this film was spectacular thanks to some stunning cinematography. The cast was phenomenal, providing some of their best performances to date and can easily see some Oscar nominations incoming. Especially when it comes to Austin Butler stealing the show taking on the role of Feyd-Rautha, one of the best villain performances in a while. To top that all off, Hans Zimmer continues to prove he is one of the greatest composers of all time with such a powerful and emotional score. ""Dune: Part Two"" is an easy reminder as to why I love films so much and Denis Villeneuve blessed us with such a beautiful and powerful cinematic experience.",positive
708,"Having just experienced ""Dune: Part Two,"" I'm utterly convinced that it stands among the greatest films ever created. Denis Villeneuve has delivered a follow-up that amplifies every breathtaking aspect of its predecessor.The sheer scope of this movie is awe-inspiring. The world of Arrakis unfolds with such meticulous detail and grand scale that you feel fully immersed in this alien yet starkly beautiful setting. The visual effects are nothing short of mind-blowing; from the majesty of the colossal sandworms to the intricate spectacle of futuristic battles, each frame is a masterclass in cinematic artistry.But it's not just a visual feast. The story in ""Part Two"" takes a bolder, more complex turn. The political intrigue intensifies, the stakes feel impossibly high, and the depths of Paul Atreides' destiny are plumbed in ways that are both thrilling and deeply thought-provoking. While the film is grand and epic, it skillfully balances spectacle with profound character moments and a plot laden with themes of prophecy, power, and the consequences of choice.If you were a fan of the first ""Dune,"" prepare to be blown away. If you're a lover of cinema itself, this film is an absolute must-see.",positive
709,"This is simply stunning in every way. Gorgeous cinematography, exceptional sound, great performances, phenomenal battle scenes, political intrigue and manipulation, religious symbolism, you name it it's there, and all done brilliantly. I enjoyed Part one but this is on entirely different level.You don't need to have seen part one to enjoy this, it can be viewed as a standalone film in its own right. Of course if you have seen part one some elements will be that much easier to grasp. It's a testament to Villeneuve that he has pulled that off without any flashbacks retelling of anything in part one and make it completely understandable to a new viewer.Some of the set pieces are astounding, and my internal cheerleader was whooping silently in my head on a number of occasions. On a couple of occasions I resisted the temptation, to stand up and cheer. It's extremely rare for any film to make me feel that way no matter how good.Timothy Chalamet has never been better, his performance totally befitting the part of Paul.The studio were right to delay release so the cast could promote it. It deserves to be seen by a wide audience and not just sci-fi fans and the cast and crew should be rightly proud of the achievement, a sold out theatre in the middle of a weekday afternoon tells you everything. If you make a movie as good as this the cinema is the best place to see it. Don't wait see it now.I believe that we will look back on this in years to come and it will be regularly included in lists of all-time classics.",positive
710,"What an experience, I left my 70mm screening on the premier in Leicester Square London absolutely buzzing. This is the first review I've done of a film, and I couldn't think of something that deserves it more.Having been a fan of the books and franchise for a long time, Denis Villeneuve does not hold back, the pacing is perfect, despite the run time of three hours, it does not feel longed out (unlike for instance; the Hobbit).It would be an understatement to say this film is brought alive by the excellent music of Hans Zimmer and his crew, the perfect blend of his craft with the imagination of Denis Villeneuve creates the most breathtaking visuals and an experience to remember.",positive
711,"I originally rated this a 10 because I was so...sooo hyped..but, now after seeing the movie for the second time...It's just a decent movie but nothing memorable to be honest..literally no scenes stuck with me except for the ones with Feyd rautha and Harkonnens maybe..I finished the movie and I was like, oh well...I guess the story moved forward..THAT'S IT...the first movie just had magic since the first few minutes and it kept getting better and better the more you rewatch it ( I originally rated it a 3 but now I think it's an 8!)...and that's the reason we were so hyped for part two, especially after watching those AMAZING trailers..I thought we're going to see something so grand and epic, I also thought it would be longer!..but No..Honestly nothing memorable..and I think I already stopped thinking about it!..what really bothers me, Denis Villeneuve had all the tools and a fan base that really believes in him...and you can still see it in some moments in the movie...It's the glimpse of the magic and epicness he could have given us and..I seriously don't know why it turned out to be so underwhelming in the end!..I swear, I was counting the days for this one and I thought this would be such a blast and the trailers were out of this world!... I'm so bummed guys!..",positive
712,"This is it guys!!!!That's the landmark movie of the 21st century. I want to begin by highlighting that this IS NOT a movie, it's a whole experience (supposing you see it in the big screen). The whole room vibrating, the score, the perspective of Denis, the seat movement happening because of the sound shattering vibrations - it's really a whole new experience which I hope sets the standard for all movies and directors to come. I want everyone reading this review to understand that this experience was closer to a simulation rather than a movie. You will literally never witness something like it if you don't see it on the big screen.Lastly I want to praise Denis Villeneuve. Even if you are not a cinema enthusiast and even if you don't care for things such as the art of directing a movie, the work Denis has done cannot go unnoticed. I am referring to everyone, even if you don't know what directing means or the different directing techniques, YOU WILL find yourself completely understanding the directing perspective leaving the room speechless at the end.Mark your calendars people!!!!!! Movie history was made in 2024.",neutral
713,"I dont know what are these reviews about but for me dune part 1 and 2 are just mediocre. Stunning cinematography and direction, sound design,music, costumes,actors etc. But somehow still feels empty. I dont care for a single one character on the screen. I was bored in both of the movies. Too long to watch and in my opinion never delivers my expectations. I dont know what is the issue here but the movie doesnt have ""identity"". All character are irrelevant and the develpoment and scenario are absent. Didn't have good time watching both of these so i would recommend guys just skip it. Felt just waste of money for me.",positive
714,"Why would a great filmmaker needed to put a cheap romance in his films. Many filler scenes with jumpings throughout the story. If I was a 13 year old wathcing a sci-fi for the first time I would have given this 10. In my opinion if you are really interested in the story of Dune, dont watch the movie. I wanted the read the books but its kinda ruined for my imagination. Drug addict with an attitude from Euphoria will always come to mind. I mean can't she act, it is always the same gestures and all. I know Euphoria should not be relevant but only difference in zendayas acting is tying her hair, I think i can.",positive
715,"The best move I have ever seen at the theater
Nothing missing for real 10/10.The cinematography and direction in this film is something else, from another planet, from another world. Literally, literally, literally. Three hours of this passed as if it were five minutes. Creativity, creativity, unparalleled creativity. I cannot wait for the third part. I am ready to pay more to see the third part today.The only thing is, I was hoping that the fights would be longer and that the opposite character would be present for a longer period or that they would be on the side of the savior and the savior, because they will have a fierce battle.",positive
716,"After watching Dune 2 in the theaters last night, I can ensure that this is the ultimate culmination of Denis Villeneuve's vision for Dune. He can improve upon his previous masterpiece of the first Dune movie in 2021 tenfold. Each shot, each frame is pure artistry. It truly highlights the breadth of the vastness of the desert and mythical culture of Dune. From the desert sunsets in the sky to the fierce fighting sequences in the sands, each scene is a one of amazing magnitude. And the visual effects for every sandworm, ship, and every single aspect is one of master quality. Each sand worm and ornithopter feels so realistic and tangible, like I am watching a real-life documentary than a sci fi film. This is especially important given all the CGI complaints over the past year and a half. But rest assure, the visual effects for Dune are all beautifully painstakingly created and are sheer works of craftsmanship.",positive
717,"To see a successor so good that it almost outshine it's predecessor is rare. Last time I saw this happen was with the Dark knight. I don't want it to be another dark knight because I want Dune 3 to ascend even beyond this but the bar is set just too high.Through the movie characters are given more depth, new ones are introduced there motivations are shown, and yet we cannot simply say who to root for. All characters have their own sets of dynamics and even the simplest of lines in part 1 are given a grand entry in part 2. The visionary director once again succeeded in providing some new breathtaking visuals and too see Hans Zimmer give another great musical is just the cherry on top you need.Overall it's a great movie and a great successor to Dune 1. The scale is set too high but I know the director will have something new waiting for us in part 3 as well.",positive
718,"Villeneuve is an utter genius. This film is absolutely remarkable in so many ways. The visuals are drenched in excellence, and It makes the experience magical.For an almost three hour movie you do feel the length at moments, but it is all necessary to tell the story properly. A story which can seem so impossible to pull from Herbert's book, but yet is done masterfully.The cast is excellent with the exception of one being a miscast. I love Christopher Walken but it was hard to not internally laugh at his iconic voice during the film.Hans Zimmer of course delivers again, though part one's score had stronger moments.Dune Part one and Part two is no doubt the science fiction grand epic of the 2020's.",positive
719,"This movie was amazing! I loved it so much ! Florence did so good it was a very good intro to her part..
O gosh Timoth√©e was so good . But Austin was 100% my favorite character in this movie! I love him in general he is a very kind guy but in the movie he really plays his part well he is a very bad guy a bloodthirsty villain. And honestly I went to see the movie to see him because I am a big fan but when I saw it he was bald!!! Like he looks so different without hair. Hahaha ....this movie was a huge upgrade from the first one because it wasn't as exciting and very confusing If u haven't read the book. Zendaya was so good I love her character and everything. But anyway definitely my fav movie ever!",positive
720,"Truly amazing. I have no words. It was the sequel that not only we so deeply wanted, but also desperately needed. It follows a journey of discovery, power, the rising of a true leader. Lisan al Gaib, creating His own path, leading towards the ""Green Paradise""... I simply cannot wait to see what the director has in store for the ending of such an epic story. Paul has grown a lot, and his evolution is clearly visible throughout the whole duration of the movie.The entire setting was just fantastic. The music, the scenery, the action... It really kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! One might think that 3 hours is a lot, but so much happened during this time, that I didn't even notice.I will be waiting with great enthusiasm the return of Muad'Dib, for everything seems uncertain now. Many new questions have risen, and challenges have yet to be completed. War is not over...",positive
721,"This movie is a huge step-up to the first instalment. It is the very movie the cinema industry needs at this current slum in film quality.Take Madame Web, for example. A result of poor production and corrupt admin. The movie is worse than horrible because it's been flushed out of production with no second thought purely so the investors can take their bag and move on.Dune is quite literally the complete opposite of this. The developers have a deep connection to the source material, and their devotion is crystal clear.Dune: Part 2 is a culmination of hard work, dedication, commitment and the proper use of narrative storytelling and structure. There are no points in this movie where one may 'fall asleep' which was where the first movie fell off.The way in which the movie has been structured and presented allows the viewer to completely immerse themselves, making them feel like they are within the world of Dune itself, watching events play out as a warrior along Paul's side or one of his religious fanatics.The movie, in most senses, actually moves TOO fast - which may hurt the interpretation of what's presented (because most moviegoers are far too used to the poor and eye-candy structure of most current action films). But, nonetheless, if you pay proper attention and try your best to understand, you probably will.On a side note, this movie couldn't have achieved what it has without its predecessor. Many have forgotten what happened in the first instalment because of its failure to properly entertain the audience, but after breaking down the first film you can see the dependance the sequel has to the first film.One last point, this movie would not be the achievement that it is without its stunningly beautiful use of soundtrack and CGI.This film goes above and beyond in the way it integrates the music with narrative tension and overall impact. It would not have been as jaw-dropping without Hanz Zimmer's S-tier performance and love of composition - should i even mention how well he immerses himself into the film's universe to produce such fitting and unique sound?Additionally, this film stands as a manual on how to properly use CGI and stage control. It goes against the current methods of using animation to please the eye, and yet, showed us things more stunning and impactful than the poorly rendered scenes presented by studios such as Marvel and Sony that everyone seems to appreciate way too much.Control over production, is control over impact!",positive
722,"See in Dolby Vision not IMAX. I'm not sure why so many people prefer a bigger screen to Dolby Vision HDR and e theater room built FOR Dolby Atmos.I don't go to the theater much anymore because I generally prefer my recently acquired LG SIGNATURE 97"" Class OLED Evo M3 which was a significant investment (but felt the same about my 77"" G2).As a huge fan of the book I knew it would be basically impossible to capture all aspects of the storyline but felt the 1980's film did a much better job of explaining essential plot lines and mystic/religious undertones and personal struggles for several main characters that were so important to the book but barely touched on, glossed over or completely omitted even though this production had more than 6 hours over two films to take the time to explore them. Had I not read the book several times I would have felt completely lost watching both films in the theater. I thought the pacing and action made this sequel a bit more exciting for anyone who had never read the book but I had to see it twice because I spent much of my first viewing explaining missing elements that tied the overall plot together so that it made sense to them.The visuals and cinematography are grand in scale and mind blowing, though and make the 1980's movie look as low budget as a modern indie film and the soundtrack and was so amazing it was like it was as much of a character as the actors themselves. Though initially taken aback by some of the MAJOR plot changes they did lessen my enjoyment of the movie.SPOILERS:Problems I had as such a HUGE fan of the book:1.) The Harkonnens never seemed quite menacing enough or as much of a threat as they were in the book and their defeat seemed much too easy. They came across more as menacing bafoons.2.) It was never explained just how important Spice was and why: it was the only way to travel instantly cross the universe and the Harkonnens were so wealthy and powerful because of it.3.) The importance of the relationship between Timothy Chalomet and his Mother as well as his relationship to Zendaya fell short of how important they were in the book.4.) The different religious themes of the book were greatly undermined to make the movie almost entirely political but since religion is being phased out of our secular world why not phase it out of fictional books, right?5.) Timothy Chalomet's performance and transformation from the beginning of the first film to the end of the second was impressive to watch which is a testament to his artistry as an actor but the film left out a lot of the training and studying of both his physical skills and knowledge made that transition seem much easier for him in both films than they were in the book but I understand time constraints.Many of these issues have been addressed in other reviews so I won't go on...The beauty and music of this movie were a masterpiece of cinematography, lighting, sound and an awe inspiring soundtrack. Though I harper on several things in my review I thoroughly enjoyed the film (especially the 2nd time when I could simply watch it without constantly answering questions from friends who were completely lost amongst the am a ting visuals. I imagine I will enjoy it more with future viewings at home and I feel this sequel was much better and entertaining than the first which is why I gave it a good rating but find it far from the masterpiece others have called it. I preferred Blade Runner 2049 to Dune and would reserve ""Masterpiece"" to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (Extended Cuts), MCU's Infiniti Saga which has mostly gone down hill since, and The Chosen series, the Foundation series, Alien and Aliens (Extended Cuts) and the entire Star Wars Saga including Mandalorian and the other side movies and TV Series just to give you an idea of MY tastes. I would include Both Blade Runners as Masterpieces and considering Ive watched Mad Max, Atomic Blonde and Ex Machina well over a dozen times I might venture to call them ""Masterpieces""... but not Dune.",positive
723,"Anyone who has read the breathtakingly detailed and dramatically written books by Frank Herbert knows that every film would need minimum 24 hours of running time.But to integrate Herbert's language of the Fremen ""Chakobsa"", to put all the love the producers and all their teams and characters invested in the details creating this breathtaking movie is rare and best of. That Frank Herbert's son is co producer, represents the deep believe in that epic theme-movie project.Not to forget the spectacular soundtrack.Part Two is unexpectedly well implemented. I hope for many Oscars!!!Patrice Vermette is for sure good again for.If you like the films, you should definitely read volumes 1-3.",positive
724,"As a film unconnected to the book it's a great spectacle with good production values and performances. As a representation of the book it's much poorer than Lynch's 1984 version. Villeneuve seems to have written his own story, barely paying lipservice to Herberts original, compressing timelines, foresaking all the political subtlety and omiting.some characters completely in an attempt to bring 'drama' and 'conflict' to relationships which don't really need them. If there is a sequel it will no doubt be even further from the original. Villeneuve seems to have proved this book IS unfilmable, at least by him! Lord of the Rings this ain't!!!",positive
725,You can only omit so much you lose a lot of the meaning in the book. I wonder if they even read the book. The David lynch version is far better than this one. The acting was decent. The special effects especially the sandworm was poor. If you read the book you will be disappointed. If you haven't read the book please do it us not this junk. Pual's sister isn't even born at the start of the war. I think the director has misinterpreted the entire story. They plan on doing children of dune. I wish they would not do it. After this poor attempt. You have a novel that has been renowned for years and then you twist it by leaving out major parts of the story. No weirding devices. A lot goes on in dune simple things have a profound difference in the story.,negative
726,"Dune 2 is a rare gem of a film, in that it accomplishes to expand upon the immense scale of its predecessor, while also giving us a truly intimate connection with the trials of the characters within it. It's a technological marvel, breathing a much needed breath of fresh air to an industry that's been drowning in bloated budget action movies that fail to offer more than tired trends and tropes.The sound design alone left me with goosebumps at times, hearing sounds that had textures I never knew were possible in cinema. It makes me hopefully for the future of the art that is cinema.I left the theater feeling as I did as a kid, as if I had just witnessed something truly awe inspiring.",neutral
727,"Wow, just wow! ""Dune: Part Two"" is nothing short of a sci-fi/fantasy marvel. If you thought the first part was good, get ready to be blown away. Denis Villeneuve has truly outdone himself, delivering a film that stands tall among the greatest epics of our time.From start to finish, the movie is an absolute visual feast. The world-building is second to none, and the plot keeps you hooked with its perfectly paced story and jaw-dropping climax. Villeneuve's direction is impeccable, making him a true master of the genre. It's no wonder even Christopher Nolan praised this film!Timoth√©e Chalamet shines as Paul Atreides, embodying the role with charisma and depth. Zendaya has more screen time and she nails it, while Austin Butler is chilling as the villain. Rebecca Ferguson gives one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem adds a surprising touch of humor. The cast is stellar, each actor bringing their A-game.Hans Zimmer's score is pure genius, elevating every scene to new heights. The technical aspects - VFX, sound, editing - are all top-notch and worthy of every award out there. The action sequences are mind-blowing, sending chills down my spine.What I love most is how this film stands on its own. Sure, watching the first part helps, but ""Dune: Part Two"" is a self-contained masterpiece. It's better than the first in almost every way, serving as a perfect wrap-up to the story while leaving us hungry for more.This movie is destined to be a major player in the next Award Season, and it deserves every bit of it. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest screen possible. ""Dune: Part Two"" is a cinematic experience you don't want to miss. Highly recommended!",positive
728,"Dune Part 1 was only the beginning. Where the first part sets the tone and foundation for the story and themes the second part elevates the story, visuals, design, soundtrack, cgi, characters and every other aspect into another stratosphere. Its a perfect second part of the Dune Trilogy. A war movie with neverseenbefore shots combined with the story and characters. The story continues even stronger than in the first part, especially the build up to the final showdown leaves room for specilation and interpretation. The holy war just begand and with burn the whole galaxy. Dune Part 2 ist cinema at its best visually, story and character wise and just overall.",positive
729,"I have never actually published a review/rating on a movie prior to this, but after having seen it i simply just had too. I have watched a couple of movies of different sorts, many of which i truly enjoyed, but this... this was different. When i sat in my seat, watching this movie unfold before my very eyes, i was left flabbergasted. I genuinely got goosebumps like 17 times watching this movie, and it felt as if i entered a state of nirvana towards the end of it. I have never gotten such a feeling from watching a movie before. This was truly sensational and mindblowing in every way possible, im in awe. 11/10...",positive
730,"I wasn't aware of the books until dune part 1 came out , and now having seen dune part 2 , it just amazes me that what we are seeing and experiencing came out of one's imagination and years of research and brain scratching , watch this film on the biggest screen possible.Food for thought : while watching dune part 2 I realized that this is not entirely a revenge saga, It includes many layers of conflict and different ideologies . But the thing is, the books came out in 1960s , back then these complex stories hardly adapted into movies , only later ""an average revenge flick"" became a thing, To write something of this magnitude is such an astounding feat.",neutral
731,"Dune: Part Two continues the epic saga set in the vast and intricate universe crafted by Frank Herbert. Building upon the foundation laid in the first installment, this sequel delves even deeper into the political intrigue, religious undertones, and philosophical complexities that define the Dune universe. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully navigates the narrative, seamlessly blending stunning visuals with profound storytelling. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are as awe-inspiring as ever, evoking a sense of both beauty and danger. Timoth√©e Chalamet reprises his role as Paul Atreides, delivering a nuanced performance that captures the character's inner conflict and burgeoning power. The ensemble cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac, each shine in their respective roles, adding depth and dimension to the story. One of the standout aspects of the movie is its exploration of the mystical elements introduced in the first film. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood and their manipulation of bloodlines, the prophetic visions of the Fremen, and the enigmatic nature of the sandworms all contribute to the rich tapestry of the Dune universe. The film also delves deeper into the themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the consequences of wielding power. As Paul Atreides grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his family's legacy, he is forced to confront difficult choices that will shape the fate of the galaxy. Villeneuve's direction is both grandiose and intimate, capturing the epic scale of the story while also delving into the personal struggles of its characters. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and visually stunning, but it is the quieter moments of introspection and dialogue that truly resonate. Hans Zimmer's score once again elevates the film, immersing the audience in the world of Dune with its haunting melodies and epic orchestration. Overall, this movie is a triumph of storytelling and spectacle, a worthy continuation of the beloved saga that will leave audiences eagerly awaiting the next chapter. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, it solidifies Denis Villeneuve's place as one of the most visionary directors working today.",positive
732,"First off, haven't read the books, really enjoyed the first movie.Secondly, it looks and sounds great.BUT... For a movie that was 2:45 in length it feels like half the movie was left on the cutting floor. I don't know if it has been designed specifically for book readers and that's why so much detail seems to have been glossed over or what but while the first movie felt like it fit everything in that it needed to, the second felt like it left half of it out.It felt a lot like Justice League to me. When you watch the first release you're left thinking where the rest of the movie is and then you watch the 4 hour version and you end up with a pretty good movie, this one feels like it should have been twice as long.You spend the first hour basically jumping from test to test and incredibly forced and chemistry less ""romance"", we get no understanding of Paul's mother's intentions or desire. We basically get a North vs South for believers and non-believers but no continuation of the mythology around which they believe. We basically get one scene to explain the ineptitude of the current ruler of the planet and some even less informative scenes to reveal our new villain. No politicking of why the Emperor did what he did other than Paul's dad was weak in the Emperor's eyes. We get no understanding into the strategy of either army outside a 30 second scene that is basically to explain to us because it's mostly just going to be sand when the main fight happens. Why are the Harkonnens so stupid after being led to believe they were clever and scheming in the first movie?It felt like the director had a list of scenes he wanted in the movie and didn't really care how he got between them or if people understood why things were happening? Like what the heck is the blue juice outside being ""Wyrm piss"", that's about as close as we get to what it is. We get none of the visions that he apparently has.Really wanted to love this one, ended up finding it both too long and too short, really feels like it should have taken its time to genuinely explain and establish everything, would have much preferred 4 hours to achieve that or even two parts (4 hours way better) rather than the feeling that half the movie had to be cut out.",positive
733,"I went to the cinema early today to see Dune: Part 2, partly because I couldn't wait past release date, but also I anticipated the film would take time to sink in and I could let it do that whilst I ate lunch.I was not disappointed in the slightest, in fact this wonderful film exceeded expectations.I did find myself distracted from time to time comparing scenes in this film against the 1984 version such as 'You young pup!' These distractions were few, far between, and reassuringly made right at every occasion in this film.It was clear that the added time (over two films) that the 1984 version didn't have gave opportunity to DV to cover almost everything the book has to offer.A feast for the eyes and the ears, simply a great return to big screen cinema, more like this would tempt me back to a Limitless Card. Ball is on your court Hollywood, make more of this and take my money!",positive
734,"Dune: Part Two continues to mesmerize with its stunning visual effects, capturing the awe-inspiring landscapes of Arrakis and the grandeur of interstellar conflict. From the towering sandworms to the sweeping vistas of the desert, every frame is a testament to the film's visual prowess Don't let the runtime scare you away. While ""Dune: Part Two"" delivers an epic and immersive experience, its runtime may test the patience of some viewers. Clocking in at over two hours, the film delves deep into its narrative, occasionally slowing down the pace. However, for fans of epic sci-fi and intricate storytelling, the film's expansive world-building and compelling characters make it a worthwhile journey. Overall, Dune: Part Two is a sweeping epic that delves into the heart of Frank Herbert's beloved universe. With its captivating story, stunning visuals, and stellar cast, it's a worthy continuation of the saga that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment. I hope there is a third installment that finish outs this initial story. I've read that this is akin to ""Star Wars"" in theaters. I highly encourage you to see this at the movies, the visuals really are fantastic and the cast shines as always. 10 stars out of 10.",positive
735,"I think everyone has just come to expect complete hack written formulaic garbage from Hollywood to the extent that when something good does come out it's treated like
It's the Mau'Dib of movies.The first movie felt like a beautiful 2+ hour trailer. In part 2 there was obviously a great deal more development and yet there were several pockets of the movie that just felt like a waste of time. When things were happening they felt rushed and undersold and when they weren't they just dragged on.For example - Paul's pre born sister Alia felt wildly underwhelming. And she's one of the biggest reveals of the books. I also felt like Villeneuve left maybe a bit too much on the cutting room table. Part 2 felt oddly g-rated. The violence was largely bloodless like a marvel movie and intimate scenes were shot from the shoulders up.Dune is far more adult than that. Personally that's what I've been ""thirsting"" for. A movie like this made for adults.Performances were by and large well done.Chalamet turns in his usual subdued but strong performance.Zendaya seems a little out of place this time around now that she actually had a role rather than only being in visions. She mostly reminded me of an angry 12 year old boy.Javier Bardem and his fanatical Stilgar were great and once he becomes a believer you can see Bardem really start to have fun.Rebecca Ferguson is still by far the strongest actor in this series. Every shot she's in - you just don't blink. She's absolutely mesmerizing.Josh Brolin does his Josh Brolin thing. Serves his purpose.Austin Butler, you can tell puts alot of work into his roles. He does well here.Florence Pugh is more like furniture to me. Like everything I've seen her in I know she's there but I'm not really paying attention to her. In Oppenheimer I realized I was ignoring her when she was on screen and I wasn't even doing it on purpose.Which leads me to my problems with this cut of the film - Pugh and Christopher Walken just felt empty.There wasn't enough time spent trying to understand them. Less b-roll of the desert and maybe more focus on character development would have been good.Why would the emperor kill Paul's father who was like a son to him? I know they explained it but it didn't feel... enough. I didn't know or care enough about the character or his motivations to feel genuine. Even if his reasons were manufactured by a certain group and exacerbated by his own pettiness, fear, and jealousy. This is a movie. This is Show not Tell.With all of that being said - Dune Part 2 is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in years which is why people are freaking out like it's the 2nd coming. We're so deprived of quality and not original but fresh filmmaking that we'll worship anything decent.Oppenheimer made a Billy(yes bc it was tied to Barbie) and that was literally nothing but people talking for 3 hours in different rooms. We're desperate.",positive
736,"Having first been introduced by my dad to Arrakis via the 1984 movie, followed by my reading the books, then watching the extended TV version of the David Lynch cinema tale when it became available on DVD, and also the Sci-Fi mini series on release, I very much enjoyed the first film.The changes, though a couple of omissions were disappointing, made sense for setting up future instalments and also helped carry the story forwards in a more theatrical manner. I was therefore looking forward to seeing this film.As we approached the end of the first half of the film, and we got to see Feyd-Rautha in the arena- followed up by Lady Fenring's seduction no less, I thought to myself ""I wish my dad had been here to see this. He'd have loved it."". And then we got the second half of the film, and I immediately took back that thought.He'd have been mad as hell!Where the first film set up better avenues for the plot to go into future book adaptations than Herbert did (he hadn't planned on there being sequels at the time), and made certain things flow better and seem more logical to the casual viewer, instead the second movie does the complete opposite. Subtle allusions to the dangers of playing with prophecy were already being wielded too heavily in the first half of this, but by the second Paul's entire character- and that of Chani too- are being changed wholesale for the sake of that heavy handed use being turned to utter sledge hammer.Meanwhile, drastic changes to the plot not only remove some of the most iconic lines in the book (eg 'Usul, we have wormsign the likes even god has never seen before', 'I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine', etc), but threaten to totally derail the main story beats of Dune Messiah- the next book in the series- along with important elements in later ones too.Instead of Alia being born, and surprising all present in the court by delivering Paul's message to Emperor Shaddam IV (when he comes to Arrakis after several years of disrupted spice production) despite being just a few years old, the plot is accelerated to all conclude before her birth . Instead his identity is revealed in a letter sent to Corrino.Good grief. Does no one in this universe fully understand the concept of spies? Constantly telling secrets in front of staff and servants in this film, when they made a big deal of not even having a 'pet' in the room for any such discussion in the previous one, is just a terrible movie trope. Even if every single one could be totally trusted (and they know that even Imperial Conditioning can be broken, cos they've done it), that seal on the wax of that message's cylinder would have been recognised by the courier- and most importantly the Guild workers who are required to transport him between solar systems.As for the Guild and the importance of The Spice Melange, well despite being central to the very plot of the entire book series, and theoretically this film too, their importance is conspicuously downplayed- except when it isn't of course.In the books, and the Sc-Fi channel adaptation was sensible enough to include this, Paul works out how to create a chain reaction of poison that would end spice production on Arrakis. The mere threat of doing this is enough to bring the guild, and as a result all the noble houses, in line.THIS is how the crusade spreads amongst the stars! Not a couple of million Fremen assaulting a bunch of ships and hoping to take on an entire galaxy. They'd lose. In minutes. If the main vessels didn't simply fold space away from orbit, the stolen landers would be lasered out of the sky in the same way the film showed us the taking down of spice harvesters about an hour earlier. What, did Denis forget he had that in his film?The crusade is supposed to spread by the fact that Muad'Dib ended both the imperial line and the dominance of the guild with little more than the threat of giving a command all knew his followers would obey.And speaking of that threat, in the film this is instead made with the potential use of atomics. Yet said threat is ignored by the Landsraad, and not carried out when they 'call his bluff'. The trouble is, it wasn't a bluff in the book! He challenges the navigators to look into the future, where they see him do it. Not only is this classic part lacking in the film, so is his challenge to the Bene Gesserit order: 'Look into that place where women dare not look. You will see me, staring back at you!'.Meanwhile, the death of Paul and Chani's first son at the hands of the Sardaukar is totally absent, as they have had no time to have any children at all in this overt rush to the conclusion (did Denis get the same itch Beniof and Weiss did for GoT?). This omissions would be excusable, but now they may never be parents as the film ends with Chani leaving and apparently now hating Paul. What's going on here? Is Paul now going to have the twins Leto II and Ghanima with Irulan?But that missing time elapse is important to plot and continuity. The first film established how much spice reserves Baron Harkonnen had, and as a result any disruption to the flow could be kept secret from the other houses for some time. Yet instead Villeneuve doubles down on this plot hole, by having Feyd get the spice production back on track. This doesn't happen in the books, for a reason!The first successful assault on a sietch (ie taking the Fremen on in their own home) doesn't occur until the Emperor unleashes his Sardaukar on Tabr, to which he notes to the Baron that his elite could barely best the women, the old, and the infirm, as the warriors were away at the time. Having the Harkonnen attack the northern Fremen strongholds and drive them away would have revealed just how many of them there were in the North- which is vastly more than their intelligence network believed. As stated in the first movie. If this was revealed to them, why were they not questioning their other assumptions? We can only assume it is because they have decided to suddenly make the bad guys dumb, so that the next bit of altered plot can take place.Finally we come to the action sequences of the 2nd half.Whilst they look good, they also suffer from 'the Hollywood treatment'. Paul now leads infantry running along the ground towards an enemy also running along the ground. This was literally the biggest complaint most people had about the battles from the first movie, and its an order of magnitude sillier when the Fremen have access to Sandworms, which they are riding in from one of the other flanks. Speaking of which, where the hell did they disappear to halfway through the battle?The Sardaukar are treated like The Golden Company in season 8 of GoT. They are all brought to one place, with none in reserve, and get wiped out with virtually no resistance to speak of. Off screen for the most part. Was that to save on screen time?This would literally be the daftest thing for the Emperor to do (put them all in one place that is), as fear of his elite troops is one of the ways in which he maintains his rule. All planet side somewhere they are unused to and utterly at the mercy of the Guild should they decide not to move their space ships? It would make about as much sense as the US putting every ship of every fleet in Hong Kong harbour, whilst the entire rest of the US military was deployed in HK itself, just because the president was visiting. Dumb. Just like the second half of this film.",positive
737,"DUNE PART 2 GAVE ME A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCENow I previously had a similar experience with Dune part one, but Dune part two has taken things to a whole other level.I am struggling to put into words how incredible Dune Part Two was. I have never before seen a movie that has managed to make me feel this way. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack transported me into another realm. I seriously cannot understate how incredible this soundtrack was, throughout the entire film it was giving me chills. The cinematography, acting, script, was absolutely ruthless. Timothee Chalamet's performance was brutal, and incredibly depicted Paul's fury, and ascent to power. The wide panning shots of the desert coupled with Hans Zimmer's orchestra was breathtaking. The almost rhythmic battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens was phenomenal. This is a movie that not only respects the source material and the scifi genre, but that creates an almost religious lens through which to experience simultaneously the multifaceted complexities of story telling through film, and of the Dune saga. I cannot put into words the complete and utter state of awe I am in right now after coming out of that cinema, I genuinely felt like I just had a spiritual experience and I am not nor have I ever been a spiritual or religious person.",neutral
738,"This is my first review I've ever written. I've never been compelled enough by ANY film before to share my thoughts.I've seen so many attempts at portraying moral ambiguity and painting characters in shades of gray, but they always ended up looking flat, and ultimately me not caring about them. For the first time someone managed to tell a gray story, and make it thrilling. I ended up rooting for Paul, and hating myself every second for doing so. Beautiful.Ultimately, what this film chooses not to say is the most powerful. And amongst the epic battle scenes, the moments of silence are what truly captured me.",neutral
739,"We have been starved and deprived of good quality movies these last couple of years.Hollywood and its soulless companies like Wokisney have spent billions on box checking, politics, social politics, and other nonsense onto our screens. Only for it to blow up in their faces, listen to your customers and what they want! We want a good story, plot and escape the day-to-day issues.Thankfully, Dune: Part 2 is here to bring the balance back. No, box ticking, just good acting based on people's ability and to be immersed in a story.Dune part 2 is excellent, great acting, the complex situation of Paul's path and the politics involved with his choices.The downside is we will have to wait for part 3 and I want it now.",positive
740,"Not a word I use lightly, but for the first time in years I was sat in the cinema and gave no thought to anything other than the film. It absolutely demands your focus and rewards you for supplying it.Other than leaving you desperately wanting more, there are no negatives to write about.The positives are myriad. The visual effects, the sound design, the acting, the story. All impeccable. There are so many moments of stress but just as many of triumph. You will experience the catharsis of the characters as intensely as they feel it.I can't wait for the inevitable supercut that combines this and the first film, as they could have seamlessly blended them into an over 5 hour epic.",positive
741,"Dune Part 2 has arrived and my good God what an astounding spectacle it is. Denis Villeneuve warmed up the tracks with his superb but exposition heavy first part, but with this second instalment he and that magnificent Hans Zimmer pull the collective ripcord on stunning large scale set pieces, devastating emotional beats, detailed visual world building and jaw dropping cinematic undertakings. Timothee Chalamet *finally* gains a much needed edge to his acting vernacular, his Paul Atreides metamorphosing from timid, sheltered introvert prince into fearless and often frightening messiah in the making is a staggering turn. Stellan Skarsgard continues his masterclass in obese understated villainy as evil Baron Harkonnen, Javier Bardem takes up comic relief duty in the film's very welcome and most surprisingly playful performance, Austin Butler is pure unbridled feral fury, Josh Brolin gritty and graceful as ever, Florence Pugh stately and pragmatic, Rebecca Ferguson turns up the intensity to unbearable levels as her character's arc takes a menacing turn while Christopher Walken, a fascinating, bold yet strangely appropriate choice for the emperor of the entire universe, downplays his unmistakable energy to fit the space opera atmosphere. The film's best performance goes to Zendaya though, her desert warrior princess Chani is a captivating character respite with rough resilience, tender resolve and bruised vulnerability when certain heartbreaking plot revelations unfold, she's perfect. Everything that was just beginning to fire up in the first film is roaring on full blast here; the battles are sensational, tactile ballets of machinery in motion, explosive projectiles obliterating spice harvesters, lithely ruthless hand to hand combat, invigorating rides atop the immense sand worms complete with immersive POV shots and enough super sonic sound design to make you actually *believe* you are there. The emotional resonance is present too amidst all the beautiful chaos of battle, a hero's journey that could easily spill into intergalactic horror if wrong choices are made, and ill favoured destinies are followed. This is what movies were made to be, a colossally huge epic that doesn't forget to be smart, detailed, meticulously written and teeming with creativity. Great film.",positive
742,"The film is a masterpiece, flawlessly executed with a meticulous attention to detail, earning a perfect score of 10/10. It defies description; the director demonstrates an unparalleled mastery of his craft. Truly, a magician at work! In my estimation, it stands as the pinnacle of cinematic achievement thus far. I was enveloped in goosebumps from start to finish, particularly when experienced on the grand scale of IMAX or a comparable venue, truly enhancing its immersive qualities as a cinematic spectacle. The performances by the cast were nothing short of exceptional, each earning a perfect rating of 10/10 for their contributions to the film's brilliance.",neutral
743,"Hate to say this, but Dune part 2 feels like a film made by committee, stamped and approved by studio executives, and bogged down in budgetary constraints. The first film set up so many glorious avenues, each picking up threads laid out in the book. The sequel jettisons many of these, in favor of new storylines that diminish Herbert's original vision. Gone are the meditative bears from the original, and in its place are Marvelized action set pieces and down the middle dialogue exchanges. Zero talk of the spacing guild, the true villains of the original, and instead they made the Bene Gesserits the architects of disaster, why? Felt wrong on many levels. Sad end to a strong beginning...",negative
744,"Captivating! Spectacular! Full of Emotion!This film shows us that great films can still be made when everyone dedicates themselves to the project.Dune: Part Two hits in almost every aspect that a movie demands. The action is not at all rushed, everything is linear and flows fluently, but it takes care to pull you aside for a dose of surprise.The story goes in a direction that I thought they could not reach without touching the clich√©s that we have become accustomed to from the industry in recent years, but with a good construction it shows us that we can see the film as more than a film, we can see it as a real world, but beyond our own, which starts as soon as we start the movie and ends when we finish it, leaving us with thoughts and ideas for a long time afterwards.Now leaving the introduction aside, let's talk about the ""sand"". The first part of Dune seemed to me a cheap caricature full of classic Hollywood ingredients to get money out of the masses.I didn't want to watch this movie, especially after the trailer that seemed to me like another parody (my mistake, someone needs to be fired), but I said ""I'd give it a chance"", and the movie far exceeded my humble expectations!!The first film explained nothing and said nothing, but this one makes everything clear. If at the beginning of the first part we only had famous actors who were put in front of camera just to say two or three sentences only to leave the frame moment's after and never return, now we have the joy of seeing how the characters develop and come to life in this space sci-fi world.As far as actors are concerned, I never liked Timothee Chalament (He's not a bad actor, I just don't like how he act), because he always seems like a little girl who ran out of buffers, but in this movie he does a monumental work with his character.I could say that he gave life to ""Paul Atreides"" and became what any good actor should become, his own character. (Frank Herbert would have been proud, i think...).I liked the direction where character went, I saw a little darkness in his eyes after the second half of the movie, which reminds me of Anakin SkyWalker for a moment, I'm curious where he will go with this thing... Maybe something evil is coming, that would put pressure on him, but it would bring him a lot of success if he plays it well.As for the secondary characters, Rebecca Ferguson as ""Princess Jessica"" does a good job, you can finally say that she is acting and it's scares you how good she is.Javier Bardem as ""Stilgar"" is the soul of this film, although there are some scenes and moments when he seems to be forced to say or do something... thing that takes him out of character... But hey.... the 12-year-old kid's who watche the movie, must laugh too.Josh Brolin returns as ""Gurney Halleck"" and does it in style, offers an extra dose of energy and has a part in the story, it's not just a decoration.Stellan Skarsgard as ""Baron Vladimir"" does an insane job, just like in the first part.Zendaya plays ""Chani"" well, she has good lines and a pleasant interpretation.And the last, but not the forgetten, ""Austin Butler"" who kills it into the role of ""Feyd-Rautha"" (I wished to see more of him), but as much as he was, he brought his contribution to the film.The rest of the casting made a small but vital contribution. Every person involved in this project deserves praise and appreciation, they made everything possible.Regarding the technique, the film is shot in color, and in black and white, depending on the environment, which I liked, the frames are interesting and full of light.The fight scenes are well done, although in some cases they could be extended or at least worked on a bit more.The director of the film,
Denis Villeneuve brings something nice to world cinema, not necessarily revolutionary, but he shows us that if you have imagination, creativity, a little brain and a safe of money, you can make a movie that will be remembered decades from now.Hans Zimmer strikes perfectly with his music, which seems for my personal pleasures to be one of the best aspects of the film, along with color, acting and the fight scenes.In conclusion, the film leaves us with the obvious conclusion that a third part follows, I don't know what Denis intends to do with it (I know what I would do if I were in his place), but if he takes it in the right direction he could make ""Dune"" a new Trilogy to receive a special place among the other glorious trilogies created over the years, such as the trilogy ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""Batman: Dark Knight"", ""Star Wars: Episode 4-6"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (The first three parts only, the rest does not exist). I hope we remember this future trilogy as an example of how art is made and offer it as a lesson for the following films and movie maker's.I'll only give it 9 stars, because, as I said before, some fight scenes and some details could be worked on, the dialogue has a few slips sometimes and it take the light away, but overall it's more than perfect. I guess Frank Herbert would be proud of what they do after his book's.If you are a fan of action movies, with hand-to-hand combat, explosions, a good story and a carousel of emotions to go through, then watch this movie, because it gives you everything you want.If not... WATCH THE MOVIE! At least you will be entertained.",positive
745,"Part one... killer. No filler.Part two... what the? Too many big departures from the book.Part two felt like it needed to be wrapped up by the end... and that the studio don't wanna bank on Part three. Also, the script, in parts, was woeful. Teenage stuff. I also think it could have been trimmed a little in the editing department. It felt flabby to me.That all said, there were some great elements. The costumes are next level good. Zimmer's score is incredible. The cinematography is grand....Please let there be a director's cut for this. I'd love to see Villeneuve's unencumbered cut. No doubt it would be more in line with Part one.",positive

747,"If you hated dune 1 because it was boring, this movie makes it interesting. Every scene is action packed with tangible pay offs that give you an ""OHHHH"" moment. It does justice to the original work, making effective changes that help both onscreen adaption and modernizing the themes. If you liked the first or the books it is absolutely a must see.Even if you haven't watched dune 1, this movie is incredible. I came in knowing nothing of the dune lore. I didn't even know who Paul was. I am a fan of well done world building and explosions and this movie delivered. The plot is simple allowing any viewer to jump in and become immersed in the world of dune. The themes are easy to engage with but not gratuitous. Every character captures your attention within seconds on screen. I was drooling over the costumes. The acting is incredible as well, not a single complaint to be had.I had a hard time deciphering what was practical and CGI. Everything looks incredible! By far the best set design ever put on screen. It gets a little long but youre so enthralled it doesn't even matter. Even the theoretical baby stuff is digestible and makes the story all the more interesting.My only recommendation is bring ear plugs because you will be deaf if you see it in theaters.",positive
748,"From the music to the acting, directing, the way it's shot, the writing, the special effects everything about dune 2 is perfect. The best experience I have ever had in a cinema was watching this movie. It is easily the best movie of the 2020s so far. In a time where most movies look cheap, have poor acting, writing and directing dune 2 shines as an example of what a movie can be. After watching it for the first time I found myself completely obsessed for a long time. Pauls actions as many people point out are morally questionable, but he is extremely entertaining to watch. Austin Butler as Feud Rautha is an absolute scene stealer. He like everyone else in the movie delivers a fenomenal performance, more than that, he was probably the best in the whole movie. Dune 2 is incredible in every way, I would recommend it to anyone.",positive
749,"Phenomenal from start to finish. I was absolutely taken aback by the sheer production value. The acting will sweep all awards. Action and suspense that will leave you on the edge of your seat. A battle of decisions that hold such weight. Time after time I had chills from a beautiful shot or a moving line. The cinematography is something that will be looked at as the peak for a long time. My expectations and hopes were high, then I saw great reviews so my expectations got even higher, yet they were still surpass. Best experience. Perfect scene after scene after scene. Thank you so much to all involved who took us in the amazing story of Dune and created the masterpiece.",positive
750,"An amazing story telling, camera work just spectacular, storyline true to the book, and those who read the series know how complicated the plot line is, yet the movie managed to convey most of it truthfully, and with not much straying from Herbert's ideas. I went in with very high expectations and I am happy to say they were met. A very long movie, yes, but totally worth seeing. A much better adaptation than 1980 version in my eyes. The director managed to make the storyline more contemporarily relevant, and even though it is very dark and terrifying at times it portrays dangers of today's or any day's religious extreme fanatyzm very clearly.",positive
751,"I really do miss such movies. Had to rewatch part 1 before watching this and I'm glad I did. The storyline, the actors, the effects, the music, the sound, the creatures,.....boy I could go on and on and on. In case you are searching for something worth watching I would suggest this. But kindly do watch the part 1 first, even if you have kindly rewatch it to grasp the entire story. In dune we see leaders who actually occupy seats of power and we see those who control them. Just like any political system in any country, it's an all out war for power. Who controls the essential resources controls it all. We get a glimpse of how faith works in people. There's a lot to this if you keep an open mind and I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again. Simply Epic.",neutral
752,"Dune: Part Two is the best cinematic experience i've ever had. I liked the first part for its cinematography, sound design and introduction of Frank Herbert's version of a Sci-Fi Fantasy. But the second part exceeds in nearly every aspect. Everyone liked Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune"" for establishing a modern Sci-Fi Fanatsy world but unlike Star Wars for example it was supposed to introduce to the world of Dune from the beginning; apart from the sound- and set-design and the SFX the story was rather simple. Not so ""Dune: Part Two"". The story picks up speed quickly and packs tons of plot in a short time whilst never sacraficing breathtaking and perfectly timed pictures and scenes. The cut is perfect and camera and SFX are even more astonishing than in the first film. The topics this film depicts leave extensive food for thought covering politics, mass manipulation through religion, fate and human behaviour. Personaly I sometimes thought I was presented with a summary of all ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" plots, which is a good thing. Maybe even including the humor; the film is funny at times, not like Marvel, but some may be disturbed by it. Personaly I was not. The only negative I noticed after finishing the film is that the score lacks a recognisable theme, the Arakis-Theme appears one or two times, but the quantity of leitmotifs isn't quite on a Star Wars level. I wouldn't say the film is perfect but rounding up from 9.99 leads me to my final rating of 10 Stars.",positive
753,"If you are a fan of the book, you will probably be disappointed with the movie. The reason the spice is so valuable has been completely ignored, and the screenwriters took it upon themselves to create a new story, that has similarities to the book Dune.Before Lord of the Rings was released, I thought that Hollywood couldn't do the book justice, but Peter Jackson did a magnificent job of Lord of the Rings.Villeneuve has hacked a great book into a typical Hollywood formulaic movie, with non of the imaginative ideas that made Dune such a great book.The acting was good, the effects were good, pity about the lack of a coherent story.",positive
754,"I was really looking forward to the sequel, but left the cinema disappointed.In my opinion, too much time was spent on character and relationships at the beginning of the film, making the ending feel too short.They turned Stilgar into a clown so that the majority in the cinema could laugh.Of course, there are many inaccuracies and deviations from the book, but that's acceptable-trying to capture all events and characters in a three-hour film is impossible.The most unpleasant thing was observing Chani's behavior, no matter how Villeneuve justified it - it spoiled the overall impression of the film.",neutral
755,"This movie is officially the new bar by which sci-fi is measured. It is well written executed, acted, and plotted. I am not sure there is a sci-fi epic that approaches this, the closest may be 2001 a space Odyssey or blade runner 2049, but even then this is a step apart and in its own league. If you haven't seen it you must go see it.This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having.I'm excited for dune 3 now and will be looking forward to that as well....",neutral

How did the fremen manage to beat those armies especially the dune sardaukar, and what about Alia and her whole arch! The thing is without going into much details how can they take this to cover the rest of the story ""Children of Dune"" & ""God Emperor of Dune""I felt disappointed by the middle of that movie and it just felt like the last season of GOT all over again, so bottom line, if you know nothing about this story, you will enjoy it and could be a 10 in your book, for me I can give it a 6, or 7 out of 10 at best.",positive

758,"Dune: Part Two absolutely blew me away! For years, I thought adapting Frank Herbert's masterpiece was a fool's errand. But then Denis Villeneuve stepped in, and let me tell you, the man's a visionary. He's a master world-builder, and the one he's created for Dune is simply unparalleled. Every detail, from the harsh beauty of Arrakis to the intricate designs of the Fremen culture, feels meticulously crafted and utterly believable. The casting is spot-on too; each actor embodies their character perfectly, bringing depth and nuance to even the most minor roles. And let's not forget the action! The explosions are heart-stoppingly real, the fight choreography is top-notch, and every battle sequence is a visceral thrill ride. Dune: Part Two is a masterclass in filmmaking, a rich and immersive experience that leaves you wanting desperately for more. Part Three can't come soon enough!",neutral
759,"Dune: Part Two - A Review (Spoiler-Free)Here's a spoiler-free review of Dune: Part Two:Visually Stunning: The film continues the breathtaking visuals from Part One, immersing audiences in the vast landscapes of Arrakis and the grandeur of its cultures. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision shines through, creating a visually stunning experience.Deeper Exploration: Part Two delves deeper into the complex world of Dune, exploring the Fremen culture and their struggles against the oppressive Harkonnens. It also delves further into Paul Atreides' journey and the burdens of his potential future.Stronger Focus on Characters: The relationships between characters, particularly Paul and Chani, are given more focus in this film. The performances, especially from Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet and Zendaya, are powerful and captivating.Action-Packed Sequences: While not an action-heavy film, Part Two delivers intense and well-choreographed action sequences, particularly when the Fremen face off against their enemies.Not a Standalone Film: It's important to note that Part Two is the second half of a larger story. While it builds on the first film and offers a satisfying conclusion to its specific arc, it also sets the stage for a potential third film.Overall: Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and narratively engaging film that builds upon the foundation laid by Part One. It offers a deeper exploration of the characters and world while delivering both action and emotional resonance. However, viewers unfamiliar with the first film or the source material might find it challenging to fully grasp the complexities of the story.",neutral

Every cast member did amazing job. This is not an average sci fi where in every scene some ka boom action is going on, but in every scene is important to the plotline. The fighting techniques were so unique. And the music by Hans zimmer gives chills. My favorite character is Lady essica played by Rebecca Ferguson. Timothee Chalamet was wonderful, his transition from a boy prince to a leader was fantastic. Zendaya was amazing as well. The third act of the movie was brilliant. Can not wait for the next installment.",positive

762,Damn what a movie not gonna spoil or say to much about it. This is a movie you just have to whiteness it for yourself in a CINEMA preferably with Dolby Atmos. Because damn the sound and ofcourse the music by Hans Zimmer is so on point with the stuff you see on screen.The openings scenes is one of the best I have seen in a movie in a while the cinematography used in that sequence was superb sucked you immediately in the movie great job by Denis Villeneuve.Not sure if it is better then part 1 but definitely on the same level gave them both a 9. For the ones wondering it has more action then the first 1 gladly it wasn't over the top blockbuster action.I remember looking at the time not because of for how long is this still going?

Only that tells me how good it is.I would though recommend to watch on a good tv with good sound system.My take on the movie is just that it hits all of the things you wanna see in a SCI-FI movie.So if you are a SCI-FI fan this movie will not disappoint you!Just thank you director and actors for this wonderful, amazing movie!!",positive
764,"I really don't get the hype.Dune world in the books and even the 2000 miniseries is a world full of politics, subplots, many characters. DV part 2 was only about Paul. Every other character in the movie becomes one-dimensional. Lady Jessica a complete villain, the Emperor a weak character, Cheni a constantly annoyed girlfriend, Stilgar from leader to a ""blind"" follower, Irulan boring, Rabban a loser. Spacing Guild is completely missing and there is not even a mention why spice is SO important. A complex,immersive world was turned only to a personal story of Paul becoming the Messiah. 2000 miniseries did it better with 1% of the budget. Battle feels rushed, significant changes to the book have been changed, and key people are missing.Obviously there is huge production value but plot being so watered-down made it a miss for me.If you can get pass the low budget, just watch the 2000 miniseries.",negative

So here are my thoughts.Few sequels are better than the first, this one is one of them.This was shot wonderfully, you can tell they spent every dollar to make you feel like you were on another world. The action was great. My main critique with the first one was that it was a little slow, I didn't get that from this one. The battle within Paul's self really comes through on the screen. There wasn't one bad performance in this movie. This movie should be the new standard that all movies should try to reach. Make a great movie and people will love it!",positive

move forward (and I am NOT a fan of Zendaya).Ultimately i felt a quite dissapoontes with the movies finale, feeling rushed and superficial. It happened in the dirst movie, as well as in the second.All in all. It feel this movie could have been a lot better then it actually was if the final half focussed less on Zendaya and Chalamet and more on the actual story/pay-off. Alternatively, they should have cut C & Z screentime in half.",positive

768,"Dune,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve, stands as a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking, epitomizing the perfect fusion of visionary storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and captivating performances. As the second installment in Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic science fiction saga, ""Dune 2"" surpasses its predecessor in every aspect, solidifying its status as a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect 10/10 rating.One of the most striking elements of ""Dune 2"" is its visual prowess. From the barren landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed technology of the futuristic universe, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe. Cinematographer Greig Fraser masterfully captures the grandeur of the desert planet, using sweeping shots and dynamic camera movements to evoke a sense of scale and awe. The visual effects, seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhance the film's otherworldly atmosphere, transporting viewers to a universe where the impossible becomes tangible.However, ""Dune 2"" is not merely a feast for the eyes; it is also a triumph of storytelling. Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts skillfully navigate the complex narrative of Herbert's novel, distilling its intricate plot and multifaceted characters into a coherent and engrossing cinematic experience. The film's pacing is expertly calibrated, allowing the story to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension. Each scene is imbued with meaning, contributing to the overarching themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.Central to the film's success are the performances of its ensemble cast. Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet delivers a tour de force performance as Paul Atreides, the reluctant hero burdened with the weight of prophecy. Chalamet brings depth and vulnerability to the role, embodying Paul's internal struggle with grace and nuance. Opposite him, Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother torn between duty and love. Ferguson infuses her character with strength and complexity, elevating her beyond the typical female archetype often found in science fiction.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Oscar Isaac commands the screen as Duke Leto Atreides, projecting authority and compassion in equal measure. Zendaya captivates as Chani, the mysterious Fremen warrior caught in the midst of a brewing conflict. Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem round out the ensemble, delivering memorable performances that add depth and dimension to the film's ensemble.Beyond its technical and narrative achievements, ""Dune 2"" is a triumph of thematic depth and philosophical inquiry. At its core, the film grapples with timeless questions about power, identity, and the nature of humanity. Through Paul's journey, we are forced to confront the consequences of our actions and the moral complexities of leadership. Villeneuve deftly explores these themes, challenging the audience to reflect on their own beliefs and values.In addition to its thematic richness, ""Dune 2"" is a masterclass in world-building. Villeneuve and his creative team have painstakingly brought Herbert's universe to life, from the intricacies of its political landscape to the nuances of its cultural traditions. Every detail, from the costumes to the set design, is thoughtfully crafted to immerse the audience in the world of Arrakis and its inhabitants. The result is a fully realized and immersive cinematic experience that transports viewers to a distant future unlike anything they've ever seen before.In conclusion, ""Dune 2"" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and powerhouse performances, it surpasses its predecessor and cements itself as a modern classic. Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's seminal work but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction cinema can achieve. ""Dune 2"" is not just a film; it's an experience-one that deserves to be celebrated and remembered for years to come.",positive
769,Words cannot describe how good this movie really is. Starting off this film is not just your typical action film this film has a Story! It keeps you thinking on what will happen next. It is very suspenseful and action packed. The vilians in this film do a great job they show them in such a dark way that gives them justice that they are a strong villian. Paul as the character was amazing I cannot put it into words on how a good role model and a great leader is. Overall this film is a must watch and it is only to be seen on IMAX because it was designed for it with the aspect ratio. And this film deserves an Oscar for sure.,positive

771,"Dune: Part Two is a thrilling film that offers sensory and imaginative immersion. It features a lone figure atop a worm, a man trapped by a psychic seduction, and gladiatorial combat on an inhospitable planet. The film is a testament to Denis Villeneuve's 2021 gamble in adapting half of Frank Herbert's foundational sci-fi novel, with no guarantee of a sequel. The film's audacious moments and inhospitable environment make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. In the book ""Dune Messiah,"" the idea of heroic destiny is exposed as a lie created by others for colonization and control. Paul Atreides, a Fremen warrior, arrives on the desert planet of Arrakis, only to discover he is the product of generations of genetic manipulation by his mother, Lady Jessica, and her Bene Gesserit clan. Their work spreads whispers of a prophet, the Lisan al-Gaib, leading the indigenous Fremen people towards freedom. The House of Atreides falls, and Paul and Lady Jessica seek sanctuary and acceptance with a Fremen tribe. Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor, worries about her father's inaction. Herbert wrote the sequel, Dune Messiah, partly in response to those who believed they had failed to grasp the sinister implications of Paul's ascendancy. Villeneuve has expressed his ambition to turn Messiah into a third film, but it is no guarantee. The final third of Part Two emanates pure menace, unlike any other blockbuster in existence. Chalamet and Ferguson's performances in the film are criticized for being overly regal and dignified. Chani plays a crucial role as the moral center, Zendaya, with clarity and resolution. Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd's Baron Harkonnen returns, and his nephew and heir, Feyd-Rautha, is introduced by Austin Butler. Butler's uncanny Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd impersonation makes the audience question whether his sons Alexander, Gustaf, Bill, and Valter are about to be replaced. Butler's portrayal of Sting in metal underpants and his entire body is a testament to his talent and dedication. Villeneuve's film, Part Two, honors the book's Middle Eastern and North African influences by incorporating Josh Brolin's performance as Paul's mentor, Gurney Halleck, and the use of HR Giger-inspired machines. The film is both grand and intimate, with Hans Zimmer's score and theatre seats rumbling with every cresting sand worm. However, it's crucial not to treat Dune's creative triumphs as a blanket absolution. The Arabic-inspired language of the book is now foregrounded, and onscreen representation is slightly improved, with Tunisian actor Souheila Yacoub playing Shishakli, Chani's closest ally.",neutral
772,"Costumes and makeup were absolutely stellar. I believed every moment of it. Florence Pugh was fantastic as always, and Zendaya showed capability that I did not earnestly expect. But above all, Timothe was incredibly captivating every time he was on the screen.

Dune part 2 is a perfect example of why audience's attend theatres, and what it truly means to provide entertainment to a captivated audience. I am very excited to see what is next for this cast and director. Thank you.",positive

After being a little disappointed by the first one with it feeling to be quite slow paced and jagged this has changed my mind considerably with the series and the ending gives a great opportunity to a third which of course was obvious with how much of the story still hasn't been told from the books. Great watch, length really wasn't an issue.",positive

Unfortunately the character of Chani was changed to much from the original. Omissions and changes for flow make sense, but this was purposeful and intended to change an important character. Maybe the director will go paint in a cell phone on the Mona Lisa to modernize it next. I am afraid that I am now out on his vision and will pay no attention to any future movies from him.

777,Visually beautiful but unhappy with the changes from the source material. The performances were great especially Chalamet as Paul and Zendaya as Chani. Butler was also stunning as Feyd and one of the best fight scenes I've seen in a while. One major character completely left out with some very random mentions. A few other key characters left out are a bit more understandable with the time restraints. Not as much world building on the Fremen as I would've liked. Some characters felt completely different than the novel. The third act was rushed. You spend less time with Irulan and the Emperor in the books but somehow their presence felt skippable in the film. He was so close.,positive

Paul Atreides brcomes the leader of the fremen because they believe he his the messiah. To proof himself he rides a giant worm and drinks the water of life, which is blue piss worm.

779,"When we think of a ""cinematic experience"" this movie is exactly what I think we mean. It's exactly the sort of filmmaking that cinemas are made for. From set design to special effects, fight choreography, wardrobe, cinematography, direction, acting, screenwriting, you name it and this film delivers an A.We have been so oversaturated with bland, uninspired, and creatively bankrupt films over the last number of years that going to the cinema has lost much of the excitement that used to surround a trip to the movies. The confidence we used to have that studios and directors were going to at least attempt to deliver to us creatively rich films that engaged us as audience in more ways than simple entertainment is all but gone. But, Dune: Part Two is a return to such films and hopefully a reminder to the rest of Hollywood that this is not only what we desire to see at the movies, but what we expect.From my perspective, a film moves from entertainment to art when it causes you to reflect on its story, themes, and the world it invites you to participate in beyond its runtime. When you find yourself reflecting on a film hours and even days after you've seen it, then it's possible you've viewed a work of art. Director Denis Villenueve has done that, made a work of art.Come for the sandworms, the sci-fi action, and stunning visuals of the world of Dune. Stay for a beautifully told human story of power and who we are willing to be in order to attain it, and even more profoundly, who we inevitably become once we have it.",neutral
780,"This movie has restored my faith in the cinema! Admittedly, I am a huge fan of the books and so I was already sold on this, but so often these days we see many franchises being brought to the big screen and totally disregarding the fan base to try and appeal to non-existent alternative audience. I am so pleased that the source material is respected and no character is compromised by any lazy script writing or misunderstanding of character arcs.The cinematography is incredible with a real feel of a large scale desert planet and the battle scenes that feel like they have been pulled directly from Frank Herbert's mind with an emphasis on close combat sword fights in a sci-fi setting.The acting from Timmy, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Austin Butler is fantastic and should be recognised has top-class. In fact, I do not think you could find anyone better than Timothee to play Paul Atreides - the role was made for him!Dune Part 2 retrospectively makes Dune Part 1 even better than it already was!",positive

Overall amazing. The scenes were shot well. There's a bit of an unsettling scary feeling in some scenes that I love. It has a great cast. There isn't a bad actor in the whole movie . If you like movies about fighting, supernatural, and people banning together this is for you. There are almost heroic moments in the movie. You really have trouble telling if there are even any good and bad guys at all. It is one of those movies that really gets you thinking. You can't guess the plot it's always throwing you for a loop.",positive
782,"I will not go into spoilers, but I watched this yesterday; I thought the cinematography and to choreography were brilliant. The lack of non diegetic sounds in some scenes made for very tense engagements between characters. I would seriously recommend this to any sci fi enjoyers, as well as anyone interested in impactful film making. It should be said that the performance of actors was also impeccable, I think this may be Chalamet's greatest area for acting yet. I will also add my personal liking to the visuals of the desert settings, however, the choice to alter the lighting to monochromatic in once certain sequence (I will not refer to it to avoid spoilers but you will probably understand upon watching the film) was simply outstanding and provides us to a completely different lifestyle and aesthetic to a different society within the greatly expansive narrative of Dune.",positive
783,"Dune: Part 2: Review:""Charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: 'May be dangerous to your health.'"" - Frank HerbertIn ""Dune: Part 2,"" this sentiment finds vivid expression in a cinematic spectacle that parallels the grandeur of iconic sequels like The Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, this installment delves deeper into the complexities of power, prophecy, and the perilous nature of heroism.The narrative resumes just after the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis, orchestrated by the secret machinations of Emperor Shaddam IV and House Harkonnen. Despite the devastation, Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica manage to escape, finding refuge among the native Fremen. The Fremen, believing in the prophecy of a savior known as Lisan Al Gaib, come to see Paul as their potential messiah. However, as Paul seeks to rally the Fremen for revenge against the Emperor and House Harkonnen, questions arise about his true nature and destiny.Director Denis Villeneuve's masterful execution elevates every aspect of the film, from the breathtaking visuals to the nuanced performances. Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is a mesmerizing blend of vulnerability and authority, while Zendaya's Chani serves as a poignant anchor amidst the turmoil. The chemistry between them adds depth to their star-crossed romance, enriching the emotional beats of the story.The supporting cast delivers standout performances, with Javier Bardem's Stillgar providing moments of levity amid the tension. Bardem's portrayal infuses the character with a blend of wisdom and humor. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen emerges as a chilling antagonist, his off-the-rails psychosis portrayed with chilling authenticity. The hand-to-hand combat scene between Rautha and Paul, though brief, is a testament to Butler's prowess as an actor and the film's meticulous choreography. Also Rebecca Fergusion as Jessica, Stellan Skarsgard as Vladimir Harkonnen and Batista as Rabban Harkonnen deliver incredible performances.The film's exploration of religious fundamentalism adds another layer of complexity to its narrative. As Stillgar fervently believes in Paul's divine role as the savior, and the Bene Gesserit manipulate prophecies to serve their own agenda, the dangers of blind faith and fanaticism are laid bare. Villeneuve's deft handling of these themes adds depth and urgency to the story, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of belief and its consequences.Greg Fraser's cinematography deserves special mention for its stunning visuals, which capture the vast and treacherous landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking beauty. Moments like Paul's first ride atop a majestic Shai Hulud are a sight to behold, showcasing Fraser's mastery in bringing the world of Dune to life on the screen.Dune is incomplete without its music, scored masterfully by Hans Zimmer. He has given uncountable iconic themes in the past and yet he manages to score another gem which will surely become the new benchmark for such out-wordly adventure movies.""Dune: Part 2"" is not merely a spectacle; it is a dark and dense story that demands the viewer's full attention. To fully appreciate this movie, viewers must watch Part 1 and pay close attention to every word spoken on screen. This is not a film to be taken lightly; it is an immersive experience that rewards careful observation and reflection.One of the most goosebumps-inducing moments comes when Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet's Paul Muad'dib Usul Atreides uses the Voice with chilling authority, screaming 'Silence' to a character. It's a testament to Chalamet's commanding presence.Christopher Nolan must count his lucky stars that ""Dune: Part 2"" faced delays, allowing his film ""Oppenheimer"" to shine during the awards season. Villeneuve's masterpiece would have undoubtedly overshadowed many contenders with its unparalleled grandeur and depth, solidifying Villenueve's status as a true sci-fi genius.Dune Part 2 is Monumental, Malevolent and Captivating, a true sci-fi movie of a Generation. ""Long live the Fighters"".Cannot recommend highly enough to be watched on an IMAX screen.",neutral
784,"When one's destiny is to rule their people, one won't quit until it has been achieved.That's what Paul Atreides, played by Timothee Chalamet, must decide in this two part epic that is still unfolding with another part of the soon to be trilogy on its way.Picking up immediately from the 2021 film, the suspense heightens quickly and does not hold anything back. With the camera mainly focusing on far and wide shots in the dense and humid environment of the dunes, rushes of adrenaline will hit you hard as you watch the sequences unfold in the opening scenes. The director, Denis Villeneuve, stepped up his game from the first film to truly capture the movement and living qualities of the characters in the desert.The film doesn't waste your time by reintroducing everything but rather expects you to know what happened previously as this is basically their version of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK within the soon to be trilogy. The main subject that stood out to me throughout the film was character growth. Most characters go through change or experience changes around them, some more than others, further enhancing their capabilities and raising the bar for how far they reached to achieve their goals. The character that I thought experienced the most changes was Paul Atreides.Paul Atriedes slowly made his way up the ladder, from doubting himself for following in his father's footsteps, to coming to his own terms and realizing the true potential he has. By breaking away from his original idea of being his father's predecessor, Paul now realizes that he can do so much more. Paul's growth from the first film to this one was immense and important. Once a self-judging and insecure person to someone who has everyone looking up to him, not just as a leader but a savior, is noteworthy in and of itself. With every good leader or religious figure there is always one downside or trait that follows them and for Paul, it's his desperate hunger for power. The further he goes on the path he's following, for everything good he's committing to, he slowly loses himself in a power hungry struggle.Florence Pugh's performance in the film, although quite small, is all encompassing, as it should be since she is the daughter of the emperor after all. Pugh gives off a strong sense of empowerment that I think the emperor, played by Christopher Walken, didn't quite have on screen. Having a high status on her shoulders, she also carried the slightest hint of worry, never knowing what could happen between her father and her people. She also brings a lot of emotional weight when it comes to her facial expressions as she's able to say so much without speaking. From the shock she gives off to the short but sweet smiles, it all makes for a more dramatic but beautiful look for the film.Austin Butler's performance in the film is quite a suspenseful one. Not only is he another new addition to the already large list of characters, he brings a vibe like no other. When we first meet his character, the color grading changes from vibrant and bright to a black and white scheme, giving off a sinister look to his character and many others. I previously mentioned facial expressions and how Florence Pugh did an excellent job yet it is Austin Butler, however who takes it above and beyond everyone's expectations. The way he brought some of his sinister expressions had the same effect as Azog did from THE HOBBIT trilogy of films, especially when he was a fully CG rendered character. I personally think he outperformed Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard, who were in the same boat as him, playing another role as members of the family.Timothee Chalamet's performance in this film is a far step ahead from where he was originally in the first film, truly showing what he's capable of as an actor and this is most evident towards the later acts of the film. Chalamet brings a lot of charm to the role as Paul, allowing the audience to connect with him as he taps into a leadership role which the audience may be able to relate to if they have had to be a leader in their lives. Chalamet takes the emotional status that Paul has from the first film to a whole new level in this second film. Having previously had more of a laid back focus to his character, even though he's the heart of both films, he pushed the limits this time as he breaks that barrier and becomes the leader he was meant to be.At the end of the day, DUNE: PART TWO is a phenomenal piece of cinema that we don't get all that often. To see this film on the big screen, even if it's not on IMAX, is still a beauty of a film to look at, thanks to Greig Fraser, the cinematographer. Would I recommend this film to the general audience? No, as it is a slow burner, mainly focusing on heavy character development, but when it comes to pure film lovers, this shouldn't be overlooked.",positive
785,"Watched the movie on TV via Amazon with great expectation and though the CGI was exceptional (aren't they all?) I was left with feeling less than completely satisfied. When will filmmakers understand that the lower-quality TV transmissions of movies fail to show any detail in night-time scenes? All characters spoke American with the exception of a Zorba-type who was, somehow, Greek. There were occasional efforts to acknowledge the original book though such was evidently not the in director's remit, but for the most part the plot was incomprehensible. Unlike the 1987 version which is much superior in most respects. As might have been expected, the unsatisfactory ending (I was left with a feeling of being left, not so much in mid-air as low orbit) closed with the opportunity of a further sequel but as with most sequels they are but pale shadows of earlier versions. In this case, the 1987 movie. Or best of all, read the book. Tiramisu? - all froth and little substance.",positive
786,"Everything you've read about Dune: Part 2 is true. Certainly one of the most immersive theatrical experiences. It's visually rich, technically brilliant, well-written, passionately well-made and will obviously go down in history as one of the best sci-fi/fantasy epics with great performances and awesome world-building. It's a visual feast for sci-fi enthusiasts like me. I don't know how closely it adapts the novel but how can anyone call Paul a hero for his ""Jihad"" being responsible for deaths of billions across the universe and eradication of different religions including Fremen's just to get his revenge? While he was well-intentioned in the beginning, his transformation post drinking worm poison was surprising but that's what power and religious fana-ticism does to people. Apparently that's what Jihadis have done throughout history since the inception of the desert cu-lt. Pretty smart that Dune replaces real-world men-tal il-lness, delusions of grandeur and hal-lucina-tions of a certain prophet with worm poison hahah. Poor Stilgar. I want to see what Chani does next and more details and history of the sisterhood Bene Gesserit, what exactly is the plan of Paul's mother as well as the mysterious role of Paul's sister. Nothing can convince me women in burkhas or nikaabs can have that much power lol.",positive
787,"The movie was good, the scenery was good, and I love that they kept to their native Fremen language Chakobsa, the weaponry and fighting was nice, but where was the Wierding modules, the key to their victory, the weapons that will shatter their bones, bleed them out from within?The Harkonnen where made to look cool I must say, the view from their homeworld and their weird look on human flesh, visually stunning in black and white. I am missing good battles thou, the fight between Rabban and Gurney was bad, rather have him shanked to death by a hundred fremen for all the suffering he has done.The Sardukar was a lack luster also, rather have a big battle between the Sardukar then letting them die of screen in a puff of sand smoke.The Emperors barge was a last luster also, the colors inside the ship where he resides its all empty no gold no nothing actually its just a dark background, its almost like it was pushed out as fast as possible, the same what happened to Alia, she was never born, sure you can change it out that√Ç¬¥s okay but she is a key player, same with the fight between the Reverend mother and Alia but they could at least have changed it for a fight between Reverend mother and Lady Jessica, because as we know one word can kill and your soul will be lost forever.",positive
788,"The first movie I was excited about because I thought it did well in tracking with Frank Hurberts book. This second part looks like they said, ""to hell with the book,"" and they changed up the whole dynamic of the story to the extent that they have abandoned a lot of the concepts from the book in favor of current day politics and conceptions. I am very disappointed, I had to wait until it came out on video to watch it and 45 minutes in I don't even recognize it because even when they use elements from the book it is so turned around and distorted. What a waste of $29, do yourself a favor and read the book.",neutral
789,The movie is an absolute perfection.The story is super interesting. Director did an amazing job with this movie. The CGI is as real as it can get. The sound and music production is top notch.The cast did amazing job with the acting. The way the protagonist changes his approach and attitude just gave me goosebumps. The CGI was top notch. Saw it in IMAX and it was totally worth it.There is only some places where I felt that the story telling was a bit missed. How the protagonist raised to power and everyone's involvement in it was a little bit hazy. It felt like it all happened very fast and chances are you wont even notice it.But anyway totally worth it and 100% recommend.,positive
790,"Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Dune 2... honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the cinemas and strike fear into your viewers eyes. Your silky smooth cinematography around the rim, and that gorgeous cast. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face.",positive
791,"I have never written a review for any movie on IMDb, but now I just had to because this was a masterpiece. I feel like most movies these days which people are excited about just flop. But the ""Dune"" movies have a great potential of going down as one of the best in history. Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet was OUTSANDING. I've only seen this one, the first one and Interstellar that is with him, he is incredible! The battle scenes in this movie was incredible! Got so nervous at the final battle. And of course, Hans Zimmer strikes again with perfect music. This is Star Wars level! No doubt, a 10/10 from me! I can't wait for the next one √∞≈∏‚Äò‚Ç¨",positive
792,"Not only is this movie absolutely masterful at everything it does, it also makes Dune Part One stand out. As someone who doesn't know the original novel, the Dune hype never truly met me when it came out. Sure. Acting, cinematography, visuals, soundtrack by Hanz Zimmer, everything at its peak. But the most important and my favorite part, the lore and story, were clouded in mist. Didn't understand a single thing, jumping from different parts of the story didn't help.Characters I never knew interacted with world I never knew, politics of factions I never heard of, it just came down too quickly and with little to explain.I saw ""Dune - Part 2"" ... This movie is the Dark Knight, Terminator 2, Spiderman 2, Two Towers... This is the movie that elevates its predecessor to heavens by simply existing. The lore, characters, the prophecy, everything suddenly makes sense. You watch Dune - Part One and you finally understand all those quick shots into Paul's head, what is happening. Legendary saga has been born, saga that is gonna be revered in the next decades for its quality and craft. Thank you, Denis Villeneuve.",neutral
793,"This is one of those movies that will set the standard high as to what a blockbuster movie should be. Professional acting that draws out emotions in you to feel the struggle that chani, paul, the emperor, lady jessica, the harkonens all have to take in the most epic of struggles for power and survival. Incredible fight scenes through out the movie. You will be set into many aspects of battle both from a far to where you see what brutal outcomes and disastrous consequences of battle to the outcomes of war. Up close and personal struggles of blade to blade, your life or my life battles. Beautiful graphics amazing scenery. This movie amazed and delivered. Really did not want the movie to end and you will be left yearning to know just as much as the emperor, chani and Paul the witch guild will end because of what they have set in play for this incredible epic saga. I Want to see more!!!",positive
794,"It's probably been said before by someone else that this adaptation is one Frank Hurbert would have been happy to have watched.Since I agree with most of the themes of the books including the relevance of ecology to the current global narrative, I played my small role in promoting this movie by buying admission.Denis Villeneuve and his team continue to push the boundaries of sci-fi cinema. I was especially impressed with the mobius-ish neo-noir stylistic elements which pays homage to the history of sci-fi and the visual novelty of large anti-gravity machinery and the Sardaukar. Hope we get a great conclusion to the cinematic trilogy.",positive
795,"As a big fan of Dune, the movie is so overrated by most critics in my opinion. It's definitely the best creation ever made for Dune but it's not a ""masterpiece"" and the epic moments in it are so short that actually made me angry.Beside the many changes compared to the origin story (some good & some bad that I could live with), the movie focuses too much on the relationship between Paul and Chani while missing many other major issues that some of them didn't even get screen time. Chani's part is just way too big; the fact that the movie ends up with her face symbolizes that.But the thing that was the most disappointing for me is the action scenes in the big assault of the Fremen at the end; that were very epic with maybe 2 minutes long! I think Villeneuve messed this up big time.The shadukar, the strongest force of the emperor in the universe, I want to see more how it's defeated. The defeat of all the Harkonnen forces also almost nothing of it was shown. We didn't even get to see Paul storms with the Fremen and fight in this battle. At the point when they reach to the emperor and his people, there was a line of Shadukar troops walking into the fog and disappearing before Paul arrives; Why not make a small action scene there?! I really don't get it. I didn't expect this movie to contain long big scale action sequences just like Lord of the Rings movies, but it seems to me that the director was literally trying to avoid them no matter what.I've seen the movie twice since I like Dune so much. It has one of the best casts ever made (Rebecca Ferguson performance is remarkable), the story is more than amazing, the visuals & dressings are stunning, the sound off course is mind blowing- all were so excellent.This really should have been the best Science Fiction movie since decades. I don't believe a perfect movie can be created, but this one could have been the closest thing to a perfect movie and it missed the opportunity to be that.",positive
796,This is a great film in so many different ways. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a long time. I did not see Austin Butler...he was bought into his role as Feyd so well that I couldn't take my eyes off of him when he was on screen. Rebecca Ferguson's performance was so nuanced and subtle it gave me goosebumps at times. And the ending...powerful and heartbreaking all at once. Well done! This is a master class in epic filmmaking and hits all the right spots. One of the rare occasions when I've walked out of a theater and wanted to walk right back in and watch the film again. The only thing that would've made this better is if I could've watched part one as a double feature!,positive
797,"Visually stunning, yes. But tbh as someone who both loved the books as well as the 1984 version by David Lynch. I felt this movie lacked in character depth.Compare the characters ofBaron Vladimir Harkonnen by B Kenneth McMillan (Dune 1984) to Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd.One is crazy, scary and just plain Harkonnen whereas Stellan (and I do love him in some movies, just not this one) is just quiet, undaunting and almost boring in comparison.Then you have Chani.. which left me speechless and almost ruined the whole experience. Her character was so far out of context for the Dune universe that it made me cringe multiple times and wish for another actor/character.Dune kills off it's best actor far too quickly (You know who)
Jason Momoa is typical Jason Momoa zero depth. Zendaya is of course the typical Zendaya.. angry face, angry character. Mary Jane, can do everything.I truly despise this day and age of film making, where movie's are lauded more for the CGI than anything else. Character depth and acting should still be at the forefront before anything else.Dune part 2 is no different to part 1 in my opinion. Both are solid, with top notch CGI & sound effects. But the characters fall flat for me all bar a couple and the ending with Charni and the changes that they made to her character left a sour taste in my mouth after the movie.Masterpiece? In CGI and sound, yes. In every other department?Absolutely not.Still very solid but very overrated. BUT considering the garbage most people are fed these days I guess I can see why some people think it's a masterpiece.",positive
798,"I thought Dune (2021) was a masterpiece of film making so no surprise that Director D. V. wasn't even nominated for an Oscar or that Dune lost the Best Picture nod to an extremely minor film. Oscar irrelevancy aside, I was looking forward to Dune 2.Unfortunately, the film was a resounding bore.I even saw the movie twice wondering if I was missing something given the many positive reviews. However, the same failings I saw on my first viewing were equally evident on second viewing.Here they are: the look and colours of the film are off, either too dark, or else blinding. It looked washed out and gloomy, a monochromatic wash. The acting is good but many of the lines are whispered so it's hard to hear or understand. Scene after scene of extreme closeups and dialogue ad nauseum. The film is a boring talkfest. Most egregious, the film plays out like a series of scenes strung together. There's little that drives this film, it is all one note. Sad to say, I dozed off during both showings.",positive
799,"I was about 30% through the movie when it just hit me, ""Am I watching the best movie of all time or am I crazy""?Glad I'm not the only one who is in love with this film. Best movie of all time? Maybe. Best scifi of all time? Easy yes.It even had great comical relief rarely seen in these kinds of films done well. The action scenes had me on the edge of my seat unlike any film I have ever watched. The freaking movie even had an unbelievably interesting war strategy aspect to it. When this movie pops off it REALLY pops off. My mouth was wide open multiple times.The costume designs are truly amazing. The team behind this film is absolutely talented.",positive
800,"Okay diehard dune book fans, this is no disrespect to the book in which I love! However, for as wonderful as Herbert's universe is, often the female characters are underdeveloped and lack agency. Villeneuve recognises this and we gain a more nuanced and complex Chani, Irulan and Jessica. Chani perhaps gains the most development, with her actively pushing against Pauls plans and featuring alongside him during major battles. Zendaya is perfectly cast, she brings an emotional weight to Chani's character that i have always found to be missed opportunity within the first book.Usually I'm against directors making major changes within book to film adaptations, and as the first film was fairly truthful to its source I was intrigued to how this would change with part 2. Major changes are made, most obviously being a smaller time jump in which we miss out of on the brith of Alia. Thank goodness, because while I am a fan of Alia within the book, an adult/child hybrid portrayed through live action is risky and often falls flat (Renesmee anyone?). I felt we still gained the importance of Alia's presence and also a great addition of Anya Taylor Joy who hopefully we get to see more of in potential sequels!Arguably, this is one of the most stunning films ever made, with attention to detail coming in an abundance. If you enjoyed the first then RUN to see it. I often hear complaints from people that nothing happens during the part one, try part two as I challenge you to not be bored during this delicious sequel!",positive
801,"Known for his skinny and boyish look, I was nervous about the transformation necessary to play the part of matured Paul. Chalamet was perfect for the coming-of-age stage of Paul's character and he nailed his part in Part One and the first hour of Part Two. But could he play the part of a bloodthirsty military leader hellbent on revenge, and later the role of a reluctant Emperor of the Known Universe?Yes. Chalamet exudes charisma. He has in him a powerful masculine voice and is able to deliver combat sequences well. His depressed and sullen acting perfectly embodies the curse and the pain of prescience, the tragic necessity of the Golden Path at the expense of the prescient mind's humanity.Seeing him play the part of a messianic military leader, I wouldn't mind seeing Chalamet try a hand in playing an action hero after bulking up a bit.",neutral
802,"This movie was a completely immersive experience, Dune is a real achievement in cinema nowdays.The Characters, the story, the soundtrack and even the peace felt so well done that is hard to believe that this movie is almost 3 hours long.The wait for this sequel was totally worth it, Villanueve knows the exact way to take audience's breath and capture their attention, he's aware of the ""peace problem"" from the last part, that now has perfectioned something that it was already perfect, making the film felt more exciting and compelling.This movie is everything that was the first one and more, this kind of movie is reason why theaters exist, and Dune part 2 made me remeber it!",neutral
803,"Cinematography is the highlight of this film and something that Villenueve obviously does something very well. I believe this is the best cinematography I've witnessed to date. The sound and audio is incredible, the riding of the sandworm will go down of one of the greatest IMAX scenes maybe ever. Hans Zimmer and this soundtrack is too notch once again. The acting and casting is unbelievable, big name actors perform their way into their roles seamlessly. The pacing of the movie is excellent consider it's just under 3 hours long. This movie really has everything you could want in a film. I believe this movie will go down as the greatest sequel of all time.",positive
804,"This was probably the fastest 2 hours and 46 minutes of my life! I can see where all the hype is coming from, this movie is absolutely amazing! The visuals were beautiful, the music was great, and the acting was amazing, just like in the first film except better. Story-wise, they did make some changes from the book, some of those changes I actually liked and others I thought were a little odd. They also cut out a lot of scenes, plot lines, and entire characters that were present in the book. But wow... this movie is a masterpiece. If this doesn't end up being the best movie of 2024, then we've had a really good year for movies.",positive
805,"I don't share the concerns of those complaining about the intricacies of the plot. I haven't read the book, but watched David Lynch's version back in the 80s and understood this just fine. Mind you, I have read Jodorowsky's Dune-influenced Incal, so this was nothing to that level of bizarre and fantastical. My concern was the ridiculous length. It seemed like the countless Netflix movies, where they think that playing two piano chords in a long drawn out way and showing characters blankly pondering emotions, makes it a Scandinavian masterpiece.Dune Part Two just took too long to do very little. Considering the book is considered unfilmable, I expected there to be too many concepts and plot lines crammed in. But instead watched three hours of drawn out, ponderous scenes, attempting to be a hallucinogenic trip but not having the conviction to commit to it.It was undeniably magnificently shot, scored and choreographed. The sound design was incredible. I enjoyed looking and listening to it, especially the unique action scenes. But dialogue was often very trite and too on the nose. The vehicles were still good, but lacked the visual impact of Part One. And characters were given disappointingly anti-climactic payoffs.This was a top end 12 as well. Very graphic and uncomfortable in many places. Beware taking sensitive kids to see this.I enjoyed Part One (I gave that 7 stars), but was more wowed by the spectacle than the acting or plot. I love Denis Villenuve's work, but Lynch was a closer match to the source material. This instalment lacked the impetus of the first, and therefore flapped pretentiously about as a placeholder between part one and three. It lacks the wonderful weirdness of Frank Herbert's world-especially in the very poorly cast emperor (love the actor, but out place here), Jodorowsky had cast Salvador Dal‚àö‚â†, and somehow that tells you all you need to know.I'm not afraid of a long film, or an arthouse film. I love science fiction, from The Forbidden Planet and Star Wars, to 2001 and Arrival; this perhaps simply suffers from the praise heaped on the original, and ended up working too hard to be even more spectacular.",positive
806,"Nothing can quite prepare you for this feast of the senses. Probably one of the best film sequels ever made, this movie has everything you could possibly ask for. Breathtaking cinematography, great acting, fantastic script, atmospheric film score and beautiful costumery. The story continues from the first film and be prepared from pulse-setting action from the outset. This is more of a fast-moving film from the first, seriously switching the story up a gear. With its stunning and beautiful visual aesthetics, this spell-binding film transports you into another realm with painterly landscapes and seamless sci-fi effects. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I can say this without any bias - take note George Lucas because this is how sci-fi films should be made.",positive
807,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune 2"" is an ambitious continuation of the epic saga, delivering stunning visuals and a gripping narrative that captivates audiences. While the film is undeniably a cinematic triumph, it's not without its shortcomings.Notably, the adaptation overlooks critical aspects such as 'the weirding way' and 'prana-bindu'-key elements of Herbert's universe that enrich the lore and depth of the story. Lynch's way maybe was a bad representation with the sounds guns and stuff (keep in mind the age and lack of tech like today).Moreover, the marginalization of Alia Atreides' role diminishes the character's significance and her intricate relationship with the overarching plot. These omissions, while not detracting from the overall enjoyment of the movie, leave a palpable void for fans familiar with the source material.",negative
808,"Due to sheer level of boredom it induces. As often is the case with similar movies, there is much effort put into convincing the viewer that something profound is going to happen right this very moment. We get unsettling music, meaningful stares, but then nothing really happens. Worse yet, nothing happens that we haven't seen (or read) before, only in a more convincing and engaging manner.I have to admit I did not care much for Herbert's book that I attempted to read around 1970 and I don't think I've seen 1984 movie in its entirety as I found it gross. So it would seem I am immune to the allure to this particular Sci-fi genre. For one, I did not find references to Arab culture all that engaging and I did not see any point to it. Second, the idea that in distant future in technologically highly advanced cultures disputes between adversaries will be settled by a kick in the groin is outright grotesque.Is there anything I liked about the movie? Yes, the sand. And there is plenty of it.",neutral

I'm too tired to write any more at this point except to say that if you haven't done Bladerunner 2049 and Dune Parts 1 &2 yet then what are you doing. Treat yourself.Dune is such an enthralling story, in it's own right, it deserves to be transferred into the two films that it now occupies. Jodorosky had his go, Lynch had his go and now Villeneuve has produced these 2 gems. I hope other film makers are paying attention. There's so much tosh being produced at the moment but Dune has re-kindled my belief that there are still great moments to be had in film making.Long live the fighters.",positive
811,"This is the kind of film, no, experience that comes along once in awhile.Villeneuve and co bring every incredible aspect of filmmaking to bear in this heart-pounding, gasp for breath, sensory assault that truly takes the viewer out of their seat and immerses them in the story.It felt as if one we're witnessing not just a story unfolding on screen, with masterful sound ( and perhaps infrasound) epic cinematography, sublime sequences, superlative production, fastidious costume design, terrific acting from the entire cast - this viewer felt as if I were witnessing something real, such was the intensity of the roller coaster type experience.I was initially concerned at the run time, but 3 hours was enough for Viileneuve to translate one of the most difficult novels to screen.Additionally, and as a keen historian, philosophy and mythology enthusiast I recognised many motifs drawn from the oldest myths - themes that could easily have felt tired, trite, and banal, were displayed refreshingly and with an authenticity that made me smile with satisfaction-such subtle nods and references to old themes so well done it was a celebration of thousands of years of storytelling, allegory, metaphor, and myth.This, unlike so many tainted films and series of our time avoided tokenism, political messaging, virtue signaling and all the other shallow cultural cliches which was refreshing in and of itself.The masterful displays by the matriarchal priestesses lead by the inimitable Charlotte Rampling pays homage to the Ancient pre Abrahamic, pre Egyptian cultures of the late Bronze Age where priestesses were matriarchs and exercised great power and influence.The references to the 'Djinn' was also one that delighted this viewer.In fact, this story is closer to our own history and mythology with a few exceptions, blurring the line between sci fi and history.Finally all I can say is that this piece must be experienced on the big screen with dynamic sound to be fully appreciated.It certainly deserves all the accolades and praise as it is truly an instant classic, and I'm sure will become a cult classic whose influence will persevere for some time to come.",positive
812,"Absolutely breathtaking movie I watched in recent times, everyone nailed it, background score omg mind blowing by hans zimmer, I wonder how Denis Villanueve managed to pull everything under 200million budget, I am lack of words simply an masterpiece movie, cinematography big thumbs up, VFX big big thumbs Ô£ø√º√´√ßÔ£ø√º√®¬™, timothee and zendaya they lived in their characters, timothee he is in absolute beast mode in this movie to be honest after a long time I can see his potential and zendaya acting is lovable and beast mode performance, chain character the way she delivered emotion, love , anger and caring is the best from zendaya, do watch this movie in IMAX format you won't be disappointed for sure, I watched this movie 3rd time and I love it.",positive
813,"A piece of art! Nice sountrack good story great actors, everything was perfect.It's even better than the first one. Even tho it is kinda long it deserves every minute because the story is extremly interesting. The camera work is very good. In the movie the Main character become a braver man and it is crucial for the role he has in the story. I liked it a lot. I recomand it as it is the best movie from 2024 so far and it might easily Wins the oscar for the best movie. Watch it in the cinema beacuse there you will have the best experience you could get. It will be awsome!!!Come on... go and watch it.",positive
814,"Just walked out of the IMAX theater (A must-see format btw), and I was so blown away by the rigor of this film. Incredible adaptation of the screenplay, stacked cast and jaw-dropping cinematography on every frame. One highlight though, is the level of emotion that are being played within the film is insane. It's an experience.Is it confusing? Even though the movie touched on Herbert's idea of politics and religion, but Denis carried us through seamlessly. Not even a boring part exists, as I believe that there are more difficult and challenging materials. Dune part two nailed the storyline for me.Please go watch and experience this since you won't get to see this kinds of movie often.",negative
815,"Yes, Dune: Part Two looks fantastic. Better than the first movie, I dare say. But it felt to me that I was watching a highly expurgated version of the film. Even at close to 3 hours, it seemed very much incomplete and condensed, to the detriment of the story.Scenes (and thus, major parts of the plot) jumped around haphazardly. I don't mind not having every little thing spelled out for me in a movie, but there were nearly a dozen times where I thought, ""Wait, did I miss something? What happened between the previous scene and this one?""I honestly have to wonder if the original was a far longer cut of the film, and the studio made the director cut it way down for distribution. Because it could easily use an additional hour, at minimum, to fill in gaps.As a result, I didn't care about any of the characters at all, so nothing resonated with me emotionally. Oh, they tried their best, with plenty of bombastic music cues, and grandiose shots of troops and ships and worms -- but in the end, it all amounted to far less than the sum of its parts.So, with all that said, you may think 5/10 is a generous rating for me to give, but I appreciate there was at least some effort given to this film -- art design, effects, cinematography, sound design, were all top-notch. Too bad the rest of it fell so short for me.",positive
816,"Dune 2 ReviewThe following was my first reaction after watching this film...It was good, but it was long. I mean it was good, it was good. But it was long. Now I'm not saying I didn't like it, it was good ok? But it was long. Did it need to be that long? Well ok it was a really big story so yeah OK it probably needed to be that long. But it was long, man. But it was good. But it was long. I don't know what my final decision is because you know, it was good. But it was long...I caught someone sitting in front of me checking the time as the film slowly slogged on. Performances were solid all around. The story is well worn. The photography was, well, iconic. But it seemed a little too much on the extreme close ups of faces. My god, the lensing was so tight that in one shot the character's eyes were in focus but his nose was out of focus. On Imax, we can inspect every pore on his skin.Overall, there was something more exciting about part one, as we are introduced to the setup. Am intriguing world shot in a iconic way. Engaging characters in energetic scenes. I saw the first part twice in the theatre. I have the DVD at home and have watched it again since. I am not so excited about revisiting part two. I guess it's a kind of phenomena like the Matrix. The first film was very appealing because of it's well crafted fantasy world that was exciting to learn about. But by the second movie, it was already kind of been there, done that. I sort of had the same reaction with The Dark Knight Rises after enjoying the bombastic Dark Knight.Dune as a story is so popular, George Lucas used it as one of his sources for Star Wars. The chosen one template is very familiar, and it takes larger-than-life filmmaking to make it something that stands out. This comes in the form of the depiction of a desert world that has gargantuan flying machines. The domiciles in this world are simple but elegant. The costumes are evocative of ancient religions. The music fit as well as it did in part one.Appropriately, the second movie is simply titled Part Two. For it is more of the same. So the second outing there is less awe to some degree, and more drama, with shots of very very large heads. I'm not knocking this film in any way. I think perhaps my own short attention span is at fault. As an editor, I wouldn't dare question the wisdom of the people who put this together. It is a service to all fans of this classic story to tell it right. Perhaps if I was the director, I would pick up the pacing of the dialogue just a wee little bit. But I'm sure it wouldn't work as well.In conclusion, the movie has many good scenes of grandeur, but has more scenes of big faces. Sure, great care was taken to hire some of the most attractive faces available, so that helps. I guess I enjoy rollicking adventures more than slightly sedate adventures like this one. Maybe time will change my attitude about Part Two compared to Part One. But for now I will give it a 7 out of 10.",positive
817,"""Dune 2"" is a cinematic masterpiece that captivates audiences with its stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and immersive world-building. Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel to the acclaimed ""Dune"" delivers an epic sci-fi experience that surpasses expectations.The film picks up where its predecessor left off, diving deeper into the intricate political machinations and rich mythology of Frank Herbert's iconic universe. Villeneuve's meticulous attention to detail ensures that every frame is meticulously crafted, from the sweeping desert landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed costumes and technology of its inhabitants.The cast delivers standout performances, with Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet reprising his role as the conflicted hero Paul Atreides, and Zendaya shining as the enigmatic Fremen warrior Chani. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Javier Bardem also deliver memorable performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters.What truly sets ""Dune 2"" apart is its thematic depth and emotional resonance. Beneath the grand spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, destiny, and the consequences of one's choices. As Paul grapples with his newfound role as a leader and the burden of his prophesied destiny, the film raises thought-provoking questions about identity, sacrifice, and the nature of humanity.Visually stunning, intellectually stimulating, and emotionally resonant, ""Dune 2"" is a triumph of modern cinema that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment. Denis Villeneuve has once again proven himself as a master storyteller, and ""Dune 2"" stands as a testament to his unparalleled talent and vision.",neutral
818,"I watched the movie in cinema and while it was in no way a bad movie I ended up disappointed because according to the current rating of 9.0 I can definitely say it is overrated. I have enjoy the first part more.The problem I have with the movie is that despite its length it seems to be cramming too many events into the movie and you have a feeling you are constantly skipping ahead from one point to the next without the proper buildup to achieve the significance of some key events which on the other hand is interesting considering the length of the movie. There is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action, basically action scenes are over quickly and there isn't much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so I just couldn't immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which I hate. Napoleon movie for example had this exact same issue for me.Main character also has many ""Looking cool walking, doing nothing important"" scenes that I am not a fan of.Overall it is in no way a bad movie, it is a good movie but it is in no way a masterpiece in my opinion.",positive
819,"Sorry but no: This is a farce and a scam! Where as in Dune part 1 there was a story, a plotline visible, logic, and a clear path, in this part, there is absolutely not. It has been massively cut and shortened - or, if this is the script, it's lazier than a old fat cat.Roles are comicaly unphased, no connection of rabaul or the arch-villain from the actor to its role. There is nothing that connects the two parts.Yes, the image and coloring, effects and such are superb, but the rest is a waste of my time, a waste of everybodies time, a waste of ressources and a waste of talent.Lazyness, pure lazyness.",neutral

Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible.",positive

An interesting phenomenon was how the main character gained self-confidence during the session. The love story was also developed. I'm glad that Zandya won much more than in the first part, because I love this girl! She is incredibly talented and incredibly beautiful even in the years of the desert rat. I cannot forget about the colors of the film in which it was recorded - it was perfectly matched and reflected the desert atmosphere of the film.",positive

With stunning performances, adrenaline-pumping action sequences, and immersive world-building, it captivates audiences from start to finish. The cast's chemistry and talent shine through, elevating the storytelling to new heights. Denis Villeneuve masterfully crafts a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impact. Whether you're a fan of the books or not, Dune Part 2 is a must-watch that will leave you wanting more.The cinematography in Dune Part 2 is truly mind-blowing, enhancing the film's visual appeal and immersive experience. While the movie deviates significantly from the second part of the book, it does so for the better. Adapting a challenging book is no easy feat, yet the film succeeds in making it accessible to a wider audience by infusing it with more action. This departure from the source material does not negatively affect the film, but the more action-packed ending ultimately enriches the viewing experience, making it a thrilling ride for both fans of the book and newcomers alike.",negative

824,"I thought it was very good, I only have 2 ""bad"" opinions, the ending of Zendaya leaving when the emperor kissed Paul's ring and the other is the lack of participation of Florence Pugh. For the rest it is the best movie I saw in the cinema.Timothee Chalamet is the best actor in the world (At only 23 YEARS), Austin Butler as a villain he is excellent, how he uses his body and voice to command respect, Zendaya, she truly surprised me, he gave a phenomenal performance as ""Chani"", and manages to convey that feeling of ""pain"" and ""disappointment"" when Paul accepts the hand of the emperor's daughter, and it made me really want to see what will happen with his story. And very good performance Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem.Denis Villeneuve, he's on his way to Oscars and glory.

Altough I do not care about it, like some faithful followers of the literary work, one has to acknowledge that the film's translation could never have matched it. This is simply due to technical capabilities.Nonetheless the movie is overall very impressive with a captivating party. It is not perfect, as shown in my point of view, with the pacing problems. In fact, while the last part is utterly epic, it's rapidity shows structural flaws in the narative level.The film ends again with a teaser for the third film. The final installment of the Dune Trilogy announces itself as topping everything the two previous movies have achieved. It will be epic.",positive

He lost all his powers with those floating bags ? Come on, weak! Then feyd just watched as his family is taken out??? The emporer just sits back while Paul waltzes in and takes out the Barron?

828,"Although today, without having reviewed it, I am aware that it was not like that, during my childhood it seemed to me that dozens of years passed between installments 4 and 5 of Harry Potter, this because with the economy as limited as it can be Having a child of approximately 10 years old, I raised money to purchase the first trilogy of the saga and a godmother gave me the fourth film when it was just released. Without exaggeration, I saw those movies hundreds of times, without fear of being wrong I could say that I know them almost by heart from so many days I saw them. I never took into account the future releases that were coming and when I learned of their existence, my excitement and my love for cinema began to flourish.That's exactly what I want to do with Dune and Dune: Part Two, I want to watch them again and again and again until I wear out the digital copy on Max or whatever platform they're going to be released on in a few months. I want all my friends and people close to me to see them so I can talk about them and understand things that I may not have even paid attention to at first.I was simply delighted with everything this film gave us, technical aspects, story, script, acting, etc. But as always, mainly when I tell the story of Paul Atreides and how well it is told, I have nothing more to say than praise for the production.It is the second audiovisual material (the first was the Invincible series) that I found so good that I had or have the need to visit the source material, solely to learn more about this universe.",positive
829,"It was an okay movie, but i don't think that it needed to be 3 hours.. A lot of useless scenes in my opinion, and Zendaya looking angry at the camera for 1 and a half hour. In other words, the excessive runtime left me questioning the necessity of a three-hour saga. Numerous scenes felt gratuitous and added little to the overall plot, contributing to a sense of dragging monotony. Zendaya's prolonged stern expressions, seemingly directed at the camera, became a repetitive distraction rather than a compelling element. Overall, the film lacked efficient storytelling, making it an okay experience at best.",positive

831,"I went to go see Dune yesterday on a whim at an Immersive IMAX big screen theater although I usually just view movies in regular theaters I am delighted of my experience.It was a breathtaking must see experience, all of the cinematography was beautiful & captivating.The universe felt alive & realistic partly because it wasn't committing the grave story telling Sin of attempting to ""tell"" rather than ""show"" as a lot of modern stories do when there's a massive expansive universe to cover in the film format.Dune was filled with breath taking cinematography and sounds that would take you on the edge of your seat as you felt your body reacting to it as if you were in the world yourself.Dune Part II is true art, in Logos, Pathos, and Ethos.It all makes clear logical sense both in the narrative, the characters's thoughts, decisions, feelings, behavior & actions.It evokes a strong emotional response and puts tension in the viewer's seat.It clearly portrays the themes of religious beliefs in a fair ethical manner without insulting either the faithful or the faith less's intelligence or trying to tell them what to believe ... merely shows how all of the beings in the Dune universe come to their faith & explores themes of why humans have / need faith in the face of suffering or adversity.As it is said, all human beings were created to worship something and if nots not a messiah or some God or divine entity it will be other things like ""Spice"" for instance or power or a dictator or sex, money, love, themselves & being trapped in self centric thinking of the Ego & Prideful mind, etcDune also intelligently embodies the masculine & the feminine in its elements of its characters flawlessly showcasing how both women & men have each essence within themselves.",positive
832,"A sci fi epic. The plot is immersive, the story moves at pace; I was hooked on the old as well as the new characterisations, Austin Butler is sinister! This was an enthralling visual experience with amazing scenery, costumes and a distinctive orange filter making the desert landscapes and scenes ethereal. The soundtrack was thundering and embellished every scene throughout. Glad I watched part 1 again before this and I'll be seeing this for a second time tomorrow.Battle scenes are hectic, the low camera keeps you tight into the action. The style infused into part 1 & 2 are the same, but the tone has changed. Now it's about vengeance and victory. Religion, politics, power and romance what a mix.I left wanting more and that's what we'll get in part 3.",positive

834,"After falling in love right away with the first Dune, reading the book, waiting two years, and then waiting five months due to the writer's strike, I finally saw Dune Part Two. And let me tell you, if this isn't at least in my top 10 favorite movies of the year, I will be amazed. This is far more than just a worthy sequel. It absolutely surpasses the already spectacular first part. It's a lot more fast paced, with a ton more action. And since we got most of the heavy exposition out of the way in Part One, the film now mostly focuses on letting the visuals tell the story. And what a story it is. Not only is it an awesome sci-fi epic, not only is it a cool revenge tale, but it's the saga of our main character's rise to power coupled with his fall from grace. Paul's journey from refusing to become the Lisan Al Gaib to embracing the moniker and using it to suit his needs is as captivating as it is intense.The cast does an even better job than the first film. Timothy Chalamet, who was a little bland in Part One, slowly grows into a terrifying presence who perfectly sells Paul's descent into madness. He has solid chemistry with Chani and Zendaya does a great job displaying her love for him and sadness at what he becomes. Javier Bardem goes a little over the top in his belief in Paul, but I never doubt his passion and faith. The new characters are fantastic: Christopher Walken is fun as always as the Emperor and Austin Butler is terrifying as Feyd-Rautha. But, the real star is Rebecca Ferguson. Her development is just as captivating as Paul's and she is downright scary at times.Visually, the film blows me away. The taste we got of Arrakis in Part One is fully realized here. The Fremen culture is fully explored, shown through Paul and Jessica's eyes as outsiders, and presented through stellar sets. The sound, music, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. The color scheme runs the full gambit from the red and brown of Arrakis to the black, white, and grey of the villains' world. This is also the first film I saw in IMAX where the sound actually lived up to its reputation.Overall, Dune Part Two was more than worth the wait. I loved every second of it and you can bet I have every intention of buying it when it comes out on Blu-Ray. As for Dune: Messiah, whenever Denis Villeneuve makes it, I'll be right there in the theater to enjoy.",positive

From its breathtaking visuals to its compelling narrative, every aspect of this film is crafted with meticulous detail and precision. With its stunning visuals, gripping story, and thought-provoking themes, it's a must-see for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking.",neutral
836,"Yes there are issues with this film especially the pacing at the end.It felt too easy, although epic! Part one felt like it was a tighter plot line while this was a string of vignettes.Either way I really really enjoyed this film. There is something about Denis' directing, Greg's cinematography, Hans' score, and the talent that make these films feel so real and so impactful. I've rarely left the theater feeling so much enjoyment. It's a must see in IMAX.I started as a skeptic of the whole Dune universe but now it's one of my all time favorites. Would highly recommend this movie. Go see it!",positive
837,"Enjoyed the first dune movie, however the second one was all right but not as good. It was way too long, you should have cut at least 40 minutes off of this thing. Zendaya is a horrible plank of wood actress and if you decreased her screen time to about 10% of what it was, it would have been a better movie. The forced love story added nothing to this film and watching her on screen is irritating to say the least. You could have easily taken out 40 minutes of talking scenes that included her and Paul, and it would have sped the movie up a little bit. Just a note for any future sequels, cut her roll down to next to nothing or remove her character entirely.",positive
838,"After waiting a few days to digest... As a fan of Frank Herbert's novels, and Dennis Villenueve's adaptation of Part One, I cannot be happier. While staying faithful to the core of the book, Dennis makes his own path, and increases the intensity and complexity of how powerful this story is. The gripping thrill it brings to the table minute by minute as we see the second half of Herbert's vision come to life was something I could not have imagined, all the actors ARE their characters. The star studded cast only builds on top of each other, and elevate one another at the same time in unison. The directing, editing, cinematography, and overall production of this movie is the reason people go to the movies. As a sincere lover of Part One still, it does not even compare to the upgrade Part Two is. GO TO THE MOVIES NEAR YOU! Take your family and enjoy this cinematic event worth remembering!",positive
839,"How the heck are there so many 10/10 reviews for this?! This was a genuinely disappointing experience. But first, the good bits: The audio is amazing and visually stunning. But that is it.The entire finale was inevitable. We are told it is inevitable from the beginning of the movie, so there is no suspense throughout the entire thing. It plays out exactly as expected: Paul is the chosen one. Some believe he is, and others don't. He is great at everything he does on the first try. Everyone is convinced to follow him anyway because he is great at everything. They attack the bad guys, the plan goes great, and Paul wins.We, as the audience, do not feel the same suspense and payoff as the characters. We know Paul is alive, so revealing him to other characters has no effect on us. Also, the other characters, like Princess Irulan and the Bene Gesserit, are just assuming he is alive anyway, so their actions are unaffected by his potential death.Gurney returns, and it is just an ""Ok. He's back. They hug. Now they have Gurney again."" I am okay not knowing the whole backstory of how he survived, and I don't need to be spoonfed. But we get about a minute of Gurney doing his new thing until he bumps into Paul, and they hug it out. At least Gandalf's return in The Two Towers was fuelled by tension and foreshadowing, and the characters were there for a reason. For this, it was just ""whelp, another Fremen attack.""Oh, and then Gurney casually mentions they have nukes, too, if they want them. Another thing handed to Paul on a silver platter. Which somehow is controversial for Chani. This brutal guerrilla fighter is suddenly like, ""Oh man, I was all for killing people, but this nuke situation... bad. Don't do it, Paul."" but then that is it. No more discussion about this atomic arsenal. I don't even know if they used them in the final battle because the effect of the missiles they did use was not particularly atomic...So, while Paul is busy being great at everything but also Jon Snowing it by saying, ""But I don't want it."" Rabban is having difficulty solving the Fremen problem, so we get introduced to Feyd-Rautha, apparently the Neville Longbottom of the Kwisatz Haderach prophecy. Who we get to see be more psychopathic than his brother and a prime candidate to solve the Fremen problem using his unique skillset of... doing the exact same thing his brother was doing, which is shelling the **** out of the desert. But this time, it just so happens that Feyd-Rautha shelled the correct place, Sietch Tabr. How did he know the right place? No idea. All we see as an audience is him doing the exact same thing his brother did. Great. Maybe show us that Feyd-Rautha is more competent instead of just telling us? Because licking knives and being a psychopath does not mean you are better at outthinking Fremen.So Paul goes south, which he did not want to do because he does not want to be Mr Prophecy Man, but now he has to. So when he gets there, he drinks the Water of Life that kills men but gives women memories of all their female ancestors, and he finds out he is half Harkonnen, which is... important? Why does he do this when he does not believe in the prophecy or want to be involved in it? Who knows. Maybe it is all a ruse. Maybe he does think he is the chosen one and has bluffed his way into being trusted. Sure, it is nice to finish a movie with something to think about, but the entire movie shouldn't be a complete tease with no payoff.Speaking of finishing the movie. The finale is. Paul and the Fremen bait out the emperor. They set a ""trap"" and the ""trap"" is... jump out of the sand and charge. Great. Really using the Fremen advantage here. The fight could have been so clever, but instead, it was an artillery strike, then a charge. Christ...So Paul walks into the throne room, kills Grandfather Baron Harkonnen, and challenges the emperor to single combat (which is just so tiresome to see these days). Feyd-Rautha volunteers to represent the emperor. So Paul and Feyd-Rautha try to knife each other. Feyd-Rautha stabs Paul! But wait! Paul wins! Because... he stabs Feyd-Rautha. So I guess Paul's stab was better than Feyd-Rautha's... Okay. So, the new bad guy with zero character development is dead.It wasn't a terrible movie. It was just unfulfilling. It was beautiful both visually and audibly. But the pacing was terrible; we had too much detail for meaningless sections and not enough for others. It is not a bad movie, but it is DEFINITELY not 10/10 material.Also, the Monty Python, Life of Brian reference... please...",positive

However, past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time, but not something you're really satisfied with, glaring weaknesses remain.It's too often over-dramatic. It makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama: the zoom-in on characters, taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frown.Oh, and the shouting! Characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us, simpletons, understand basic concepts by repeating them three, four, five times. We got it. Move on! Done and seen a thousand times elsewhere.On that subject, this movie is very loud. In every sense of the word. Sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that they're saying something important. Thing is, it actually has the opposite effect. It's like a child throwing a tantrum, demanding to be heard. Then, there's the action scenes. Oh my, did they overdo them. It's constant blasting and fighting. The fast food of the movie industry. The louder the better. Explosions, fast camera movements, noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you don't have to think too hard about the story.It follows that the dialogues are weak, really weak. If one isolated the words and read them they'd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines. And obviously, it would look completely ridiculous compared to the book.All in all, this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low. It does not expect much from itself or from its audience and so you leave the theater wondering what was the point.",positive
841,"Ohh boy how I missed movies like this in these days.Finally movies that worth watching and waiting for.I thought the 1st one was so good, but Dune 2? What an absolotely Masterpiece.The acting from every actor / actress was phenominal, could feel thet tension and feeling from each of them.The Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd family are awesome, top level acting.The CGI was beautiful, it looked so good, the worms are frightning and the whole ""sandy"" area / colors makes you feel like youre inside the movie, especially if watching it in IMAX.I really hope the 3rd movie will be top level like this first two, I know its hard but I put my trust.PS:
Im not a fan of the games nor the books, never played the game or watched the old movies.But now I do. :D.",positive
842,"Just when I thought that Denis could not out-do his Bladerunner. Don't get me wrong, first part of Dune was beautifully executed, however Part 2 shines like a beacon of hope for the Art of Cinema. Editting is superb to the tee, visually the film is to be studied for many ears ahead. But! In order to keep it up to the 3 hour mark there wer cut-offs from script and time-line. I would have easily accepted this divided in two parts, just so the gaps of inbetween (especially for those who have read the books) were spared. Nevertheless, the job was masterfully done. A well deserved bow to Mr. Vileneuve, the cinematographers, editors, cast and the music and sound crew.",neutral
843,"Dennis did his job well. Cinematographer Greig Fraser went next level. The second part is much more better than the part I. And yeah, the music is so sensational and chilling. The main theme brings goosebumps. Hans Zimmer the legend. This movie is meant to be seen in cinema houses. IMAX would be much more interesting. The first half of the movie is slow paced, not slow-slow but political, and then after the intermission is where it gets bombed. Paul aka Timothee really played his character well. I never imagined this guy could handle action sequences. Overall, the movie is must watch. Can't wait for 3rd part.",neutral
844,"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. Stunning cinematography, a well-crafted story, rare errors that are almost unnoticeable, and unparalleled acting performances from the entire cast. If you have not seen the movie yet, I advise you to watch it immediately, especially in IMAX, to enjoy the full experience. An amazing movie. There is not a dull moment. Many events follow and the sequences are more than wonderful. The movie tries to introduce you into the world of the Freeman. After the first hour, I almost know their customs and responses. They did things as if I belonged to them, and on top of all of this the scenes are great and the angles make you feel ecstatic. The opening scene is terrible and the ending scene is beyond excellent. An epic movie. The action is new and the method of fighting is unfamiliar. There are some light comedic scenes, but they really made me laugh, and the IMAX experience is truly awesome. The screen is truly awesome. It is huge, the quality is amazing, and the audio experience is truly one of the most enjoyable things that can be seen. To sum up my experience, this movie can be put in the 20 best movies I have ever seen in my life. Thank you.",positive
845,"This movie made me write my first review. It is an engrossing and mesmerising cinematic marvel, on track to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. A perfect sequel, jam-packed equally with epic action and mystical realities, and accompanied by a stellar score from Hans Zimmer, this movie stuck in my head for days after watching it.As a die hard fan of Dune, seeing the adaptation of Frank Herbert's magnum opus, said to be unadaptable, on the wide screen was a dream come true. The movie is a must watch on the big screen and a treat to behold for fans and casual watchers alike. Solid 10/10.",positive
846,"Dune - Part 2"" takes audiences on a spellbinding odyssey across the majestic sands of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling reminiscent of the complexity found in Indian politics. As the sequel to the highly acclaimed ""Dune,"" this installment promises an even deeper immersion into the rich universe created by Frank Herbert, where alliances are fragile, and power is the ultimate currency.From the opening scenes, viewers are thrust into a world where every grain of sand holds a secret, and every character harbors ambitions that could reshape the fate of entire civilizations. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully balances the grandeur of the landscape with the intimate struggles of its inhabitants, creating a cinematic experience that is as mesmerizing as it is thought-provoking.At the heart of ""Dune - Part 2"" lies a plot as intricate as the labyrinthine corridors of political power in India. Like a masterful chess game played on a cosmic scale, the narrative unfolds with a series of unexpected twists and turns, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end. Much like a Bollywood masala film, the story is rich with drama, intrigue, and larger-than-life characters whose destinies are intertwined in ways both profound and unforeseen.Yet, amidst the political machinations and intergalactic power struggles, ""Dune - Part 2"" introduces an unlikely hero: the sandworms of Arrakis. Previously viewed as mere beasts of burden, these colossal creatures emerge as symbols of resilience and defiance, challenging the established order and reshaping the very fabric of Indian cinema. Their presence adds a layer of myth and mystique to an already captivating narrative, serving as a reminder that true heroism often comes from the unlikeliest of places.What sets ""Dune - Part 2"" apart from other sci-fi epics is its ability to transcend the boundaries of genre and resonate with audiences on a deeply human level. Amidst the spectacle of interstellar warfare and cosmic intrigue, the film explores themes of identity, destiny, and the enduring struggle for freedom. It is a testament to the power of storytelling to illuminate the human condition and inspire audiences to ponder the deeper questions of existence.As the credits roll and the echoes of the final battle fade into the ether, one cannot help but feel a sense of longing for more. Like a plate of piping hot samosas on a rainy day, ""Dune - Part 2"" leaves audiences craving for another taste of its intoxicating blend of action, suspense, and spectacle. It is a testament to the enduring appeal of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination and leave us forever changed by the experience.",neutral
847,"I was really looking forward to see this movie. I liked the first one and the old one from 1984. I don't want to say that, but the film is a fart in the wind instead of a thunder.Like Villeneuve's Bladerunner 2049 the optics and style are awesome, However the characters and plot give the impression of depth where is none in the end. The same disappointment when the movie comes to it's conclusion. The fact there might be a part 3 does not change that.What are the big flaws of Dune part two? Paul is shown as humble and only wants to help. He is aware of the dangers of beeing a messiah only to go full megalomania once he drinks the water of life. And the final battle is underwhelming. No real struggle to win, no clever descissions to turn the tide, no new weapons or ships to see. Other characters are even worse. - Yes the emperor is supposed to be weak, but he is so dull that it's impossible to belive he made it to such a high age in this position. - Vladimir Harkonnen was dangerous and terrifying in part one. Now he is shown to be strangely submissive when facing a joke of an emperor and his nephew who might become his successor. That doesn't fit his character at all. - Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen has to fight drugged opponents in the colosseum and a doctor, suddenly he is the big scary final boss? - The Fremen were the good guys where Paul was supposed to grow together with and fight for them to give them a better future. Now it feels like they are nothing more like some native tribe who is manipulated with witchcraft to be a tool of power for the next emperor.There are several other points, but these are the most important reasons why the pretty pictures are not enough to make this film satisfying to watch.Like John Carter of Mars. Nice to see, but so very meh at the end..",positive
848,"A worthy squeal. As with part 1, the cinematography was excellent. The use of scale and angles was a pleasure to the eye. If you are familiar with the novels you will see they are moving the story along well with a little tweaking here and there.I love Christopher Walken but not sure he needed to be in this film.The music is as grand as the scenery. And I was not disappointed at all with the worm riding. You could almost feel how hard it must be to do. Great directing and special effects. And the actors and actresses made you feel with them as good performers should.Looking forward to the 3rd.",positive
849,"I like both episodes, and it is better than the first episode of the sequel but I am still a bit clueless at some parts of the story. Certain parts seem slack and not expalined while other parts are suddenly fasten and jumping a lot. Scenes, sound, visuals are amazing but cannot feel connected to non of the characters. Story is a bit slow, despite it is interesting. Could bear more action than 15 minutes from the 2 hours 45 minutes. Overall it is great, would watch it another time, but cannot compare to Star Wars universe currently ( reflecting on the comparisons on I have read ), but if they open up this galaxy in upcoming parts then it could be a relevant competitor among the names in the sci-fi / fantasy sector.",positive
850,"Title says it all. No script and substance in the movie. Just glittery production and soundscape. As a teenager maybe I'd like it a bit. The acting was sub par as well especially from Timothee and Zendaya. The technology and the time does not make sense. They have technology to have lasers and atomic bombs but not to improve their living conditions. Timothee does not die after being stabbed of course. I understand it's fiction but if you keep making things up the story just becomes something you recite to a small kid to make them fall asleep. It's 2024, level up your game people. You have great people to work with like Hans Zimmer but the output is so bleh.",positive
851,"It was a pleasure to watch this movie on opening day. Visually stunning, it ranks among the greatest sci-fi film of the decade in my opinion. Having read the book, I'm impressed by Denis Villeneuve's masterful adaptation and his captivating vision of this universe and world building. His cinematography beautifully portrays Paul's journey and destiny. The story builds expertly on part one, with strong characters facing difficult choices. I once again praise Greg Frazier for the breathtaking images, the sound design team and everyone involved in the incredible sets and costume design. I can't wait for Dune Messiah, and highly recommend everyone to experience this film in the theaters.",positive
852,"The book builds a very large and complicated world, even by science fiction standards. So to even dare to create a film version of it was ambitious from day one. There are so many ways it could go wrong, and so many risks. Part One worked (at least for me). I was apprehensive about Part Two, as I feared it might let me down, or become bogged down in the vast details of the novel, or be yet another victim of film-making by committee so that everything lost its colour and strangeness. That did not happen. This is a special film. It's an intelligent, beautifully made blockbuster. It's an act of devotion for the novels, too.Dune Part Two is a long, thought-provoking and ambitious film that sets out as a philosophical study of the nature of belief and religion, and manages to be that without losing any of the spectacular visual beauty and drama along the way. It isn't a particularly light or easy film, but it is stunning, and it asks you to pay attention to it fully. It's a serious film. I respect that, because it's a serious book with a serious point to make.The landscapes are striking and strange. There are thrilling and tense moments. There are also softer moments of intimacy and strong characterisation. I think Lady Jessica particularly comes across as extraordinarily dangerous, manipulative, and without any other options except to be that. Paul is the reluctant messiah who understands that nothing actually compels him to do what the prophecies say, but that at the same time, he will do what the prophecies say, because there is no other way out. His struggles are very well represented and easy to understand, without being over-simplified.What I did not like, the reason it's a 9 rather than a 10, was that a couple of moments were a little unnaturally segued into, in my opinion. Things seemed to be rather sudden developments on occasion. I also think the ending was good in that it wasn't an ending but just a beginning of a new phase of the story, which fits with the novels and Paul's situation, but it might have left some people rather unsatisfied.",positive
853,"Wow what a film. I haven't see a sequel better than the original since Empire Strikes back. From the cinematography, the score and stacked cast of actors this film was everything in one. There were a few times I was on the edge of my seat. And there were a few twists that I did not expect. The action scenes were perfectly executed and the visuals were amazing throughout. You can tell they trained hard on the choreography and took there time with this one. The acting was great and how they showcased each planet looked beautiful. The film also had a great story line that was easy to follow along. I am very excited to see how the trilogy will finish up.",positive
854,"Part one of Villeneuve's dune was following the book quite closely. Small changes that it made were probably for the best, no one is going to miss lasguns. Liet was gender swapped for some reason, that was the biggest unnecessary change that I can think of. So, it would make perfect sense that since first movie followed the book closely, the second is going to do so, too?Part two is light years away from the book. A bunch of characters have been changed completely. Aliya is not even born. Stilgar is nothing like Stilgar from the books. Chani, a side character from the books, is now a central character in the plot. In fact, on most of the posters for the movie, she is next to Paul, standing as high as him, she even occludes him. I guess every movie these days must have a girl boss. Zandaya is a bigger start that Chalmet, so studio was promoting her more.Does that mean that Part Two is a bad movie? No, it's still well crafted and it actually manages to preserve the key ideas of the book. I do think that Part One was the better of the two, though.",positive
855,"This movie really does take what Dune Part One does great, and do it just as well and in some cases better. The acting is superb, the visuals and cinematography are amazing, the music/lack thereof enhances scenes. I absolutely love the costumes. There is so much to like. I've never read the books, I haven't seen the 1980's movie, I even only recently saw Part One. Going in blind still has blown me away. Some movies really struggle to immerse you and make you feel like a fictional world could be real, this movie is not one.Timothee really steals the show for me once he comes back to life. He really seemed untouchable and has a commanding presence. The duel between him and Na-Baron was intense, and I loved how there wasn't any music for that fight. The worm riding scene was so cool too.. heck, I thought Chani showing Paul how to properly sand walk was great (the shot with the close up of her feet).The only knocks I have against this movie are when Paul is supposed to survive in the desert alone, then shortly meets Chani. Then suddenly they're out with a bunch of Fremen taking on a spice harvester? It seemed as though they rushed Paul and Chani's relationship a bit. Also, when Paul doesn't want to go south, but then decides to. He ends up drinking the life water. Did he need to do that? I'm not sure if that was explained, or if I missed it. Some of the Harkenen scenes with the coliseum as well as the shots of the army didn't have the greatest special effects to me, but that might've been intentional.Overall, the few problems I had with the movie really aren't that big of a deal. I saw it in IMAX which was a good idea! I'm looking forward to being able to see this again. To me, this is more of a 9.5/10. Might end up changing it to a 10 after another viewing, we will see. Highly recommended!",positive
856,"5/5A monumental piece of cinema
Great Visual / Great story / Great Writing.Best Sci-fi movies to date.The only disappointing thing is not making a 3 hours film with more extra scenes to absorb the story of Dune to its finest.""Dune: Part Two"" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes the audience on an incredible journey through the harsh desert landscape of Arrakis and flows with spice in the air. The movie is an adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel, and it is the second installment of the ""Dune"" franchise. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film is a visual spectacle that showcases the director's mastery of the art of filmmaking.The movie follows the story of Paul Atreides, a young boy who is destined to become the leader of the desert planet Arrakis. The planet is known for its valuable resource, the spice, which is essential for space travel. The story is set in a futuristic world where humanity has colonized other planets and is ruled by powerful families. The Atreides family is tasked with taking control of Arrakis from the Harkonnens, who have been in charge of the planet for many years.The film's visual effects are stunning, and the artists behind them have shown creativity and dedication that is second to none. The world of Arrakis is brought to life with incredible attention to detail, and the landscapes are awe-inspiring. The sand dunes, the gigantic sandworms, and the futuristic technology are all seamlessly integrated into the story, making the audience feel like they are part of the Fremen and living with them seeing what happened with the same eye.The acting is also outstanding. Timothee Chalamet delivers a powerful performance as Paul Atreides, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya are also excellent in their roles, bringing a sense of depth into their characters. The cast is rounded out by talented actors such as Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and Christopher Walken, who all deliver outstanding performances.The story of ""Dune: Part Two"" is compelling and engaging, and it is excellently laid out. The film has a good pacing which is better than the first one and never feels tedious at any moment. The pacing is just great, and the story unfolds in a way that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. The movie is a testament to the power of storytelling, and it is a reminder that great storytelling is timeless.One of the most impressive aspects of ""Dune: Part Two"" is the way it balances action and drama. The film is not just a sci-fi adventure; it is also a character-driven drama that explores themes such as family, power, and destiny. The action scenes are thrilling and well-executed, but they never feel gratuitous or over-the-top. They are always in service of the story, and they help to advance the plot and develop the characters.Overall, ""Dune: Part Two"" is a movie that will leave you in awe. It is a cinematic masterpiece that showcases the best of what modern filmmaking has to offer. If you are a fan of science fiction or the ""Dune"" franchise, then this movie is a must-see. It is a movie that will stay with you long after the credits roll. I was just so happy to experience it.",positive
857,"""Dune: Part 2"" is a big-budget film, filmed in co-production between 8 countries: the United States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, Jordan, New Zealand, Italy and the Gambia, resulting in an extraordinary production of great proportions. The cast is top-notch and gives remarkable performances, Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, Javier Bardem, Christopher Walken, Charlotte Rampling, Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd, Dave Bautista and Josh Brolin shine in every scene demonstrating their histrionic abilities. Denis Villeneuve's work as a director is excellent, demonstrating his talent behind the cameras. The adaptation of the chapters taken to film from the book ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert are scripted by Denis Villeneuve himself together with Jon Spaihts, resulting in an epic story, although in some scenes it becomes long and in others it becomes very precipitated. The technical elements such as cinematography, sound design, costume design, editing and special effects are majestically achieved and are a visual delight. Although ""Dune: Part 2"" is a great film, it falls short of being a complete masterpiece and despite the critical praise that considers it superior to its predecessor, that is exaggerated. As a result the film is incredible and visually stunning.",positive
858,"I loved this movie but I don't need to write a whole review like everyone else. Do you book readers that a movie adaptation does not need to have every single thing YOU want from the book. An adaptation is BASED off the book, not an exact copy of it. If they wanted to fit everything we'd have a 5 hour long movie, but we can't add everything, can we? Lower your expectations y'all are embarrassing yourselves. All you're doing is yapping about how much of a fan you are. Let people enjoy the movie ADAPTATION, not the copy you want.Like yeah I love the spacing guild, they're awesome. I love the lore behind the eradication of robots, but that would be an extra, like, 4 hours, and a movie can't be so long that it wastes everyone's day with lore, right? This behavior is truly goofy, and it needs to stop.",positive
859,"A summary of my 2021 DUNE PART 1 Review: The reason to see this is its looks. It is - I apologize - a feast for the eyes. Plot-wise we've got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universe's most important mineral: 'Spice'. We have a good son with a mysterious mother, we've got evil villains (Harkonnens), and a rebel army (Fremen) with pet worms standing guard. Even so, better to lower your expectations. The giant worms ain't that much. The bald villains are too easy confused with one another. David Bautista is the one recognized villain, but he's weak in his role. The film is somber, morbid, heavy; not a light moment throughout its long running time.DUNE PART 2 is better. First, the plot is more compelling. The reasons for events in Part 1 are explained here. There is a love angle between the good son Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and a young Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya) which relieves the solemnity. In fact the very presence of Zendaya's character lifts the film mightily; she is without question someone to care about.Javier Bardem is great as the leader of The Fremen. Josh Brolin is rousing as Chalamet's protector. Austin Butler as the psychopathic next-in-line for the throne receives an A+ for creepiness (a compliment). Christopher Walken is wasted as the Emperor who is, no pun, wasting away. Why he was chosen for this role beats me. Florence Pugh as his daughter is simply 'there'. Her character is a sometimes narrator; the 'sometimes' element simply confusing. Overall there is an aura of self-importance about Dune 2, as though the viewer will take away an important lesson. But again, the heaviness, the weight of the characters' unhappiness, overpowers the 'good' that might be derived.In Part 2 many of these characters have secrets, as well as secret motives, though I, for one, was never quite sure about whose motives (with the exception of Chani's) were worth rooting for. The special effects here were disappointing; the worms were an improvement over Part 1, though seriously, I wanted to see more of them; ascertain how large they are, see them compared to other large structures. But no. I was never enthusiastic about the interstellar spacecraft; they appear more like a deck of playing cards than a speedy conveyance.Bottom line: Part 2 is a good film. However, I'd be perfectly fine if there were no Part 3.",positive
860,"Dune, part two definitely is impressive visually with a great musical score. The sound effects alone are remarkable and very loud specially watching it at Dolby Theatre.And that's about it, really! The overall plot was lacking big time, without spoiling anything its strongly based on prophecy and leadership, it's very similar to many of the well known historical stories of prophets and their messages, their rise to leadership and power. Unlike history however, the story buildup is weak, the script lacks originality and the whole ( he is the one ! ) scenario have been utilized so many times in films ( for eg, the Matrix ).There are no high stakes, whether or not the protagonist is the One has no major consequences or at least the script failed to highlight it.The movie still has some very solid moments, like the introduction of the main villain with the black and white scenes is fantastic. In fact, the scenes with Villains were more amusing than the protagonists.Acting is decent but nothing spectacular, Zendaya has basically the same angry impression throughout without any clear reason why. She needs to train and work harder on her skills.Timothee Chalamant, is slightly better, but not very impressive. Dave Bautista is under utilized and both his character and Chalamant's scream too much, it's distracting.Speaking of loud, there was also plenty of shouting from the villagers ( i think they are called Fremen ), chanting words like Lasan Algaib and Modeb, these two words probably consumed half the script, repeated over and over, it is exhausting.I know the director wanted to reflect some authenticity with the languages, but the frequent shifting between English and Fremen or whatever its called was another distraction.Probably the chemistry between Zendaya and Chalamant are the worst I've ever seen, i am not sure if its their acting or the script, but it felt forced and predictable.As mentioned earlier, musical score and sounds effects are the highlight of the movie, superb and transfers you into the film as if we are in it. Same with the visuals, the color gradient and atmosphere sucks you into the world of Dune, its such an experience! But after a while, one wants a story arc to keep ones interest high, which lacked.I would probably say the costume design department is the best, definitely impressive style and unique costume designs for almost all characters, could be nominated for best costume design.Action scenes were loud and impressive but lacked tension because as I mentioned there are no high stakes for our protagonist losing. Not to mention, battle scenes are brief and felt rushed. I was expecting epic battles with strategies and action sequences, something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but there is no emphasis or focus on the battle scenes, specifically the final battle scene.So yeah, it is ok with some memorable scenes, but left me generally disappointed and I think its over hyped, I do recall liking the first movie more. It could have at least be shorter than 2 hours 45 minutes or some better choreography and tension in battles scenes. A little less emphasis on the prophecy angle.",positive
861,"Finally a modern day epic that lives up to its lore!Denis Villeneuve, achieved several notable accomplishments. Firstly, it successfully adapted Frank Herbert's complex and beloved novel into a visually stunning and immersive cinematic experience.Stunning visuals, intricate world-building, and faithful interpretation of the source material. Additionally, Villeneuve's direction skillfully balanced action, politics, and philosophy, creating a rich narrative that appealed to both fans of the book and newcomers to the Dune universe. Moreover, the film's cast, including Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac, delivered compelling performances that brought the characters to life. Overall, Villeneuve's ""Dune"" Must be hailed a masterpiece.This film delivers on every aspect of an epic. The acting, the cinematography, the story. All fantastic. I struggle to find the superlatives to properly describe this movie. The score is perfection, the action scenes spectacular. What the team behind this movie have done in terms of creating another world is unmatched in recent history. It feels real.",positive
862,"Quite possibly the easiest rating I will have to give to any movie that comes out this year. Not only is Dune Part 2 better than it's predecessor it is better than any Si-Fi movie in the last 10 years with the narrow and arguable exception to Interstellar. If this does not speak to the magnitude of Dune Part 2 then I don't know what does because for a Si-Fi action film this is as good as it gets almost perfect with nothing I would change as the viewer some ideas of this would be the actors the use of visual affects and CGI in certain areas of the film, and even the casting was unarguable.First of all, I would like to shed light on Austin Butler, because not only was he incredible and honestly a surprise; he was absolutely terrifying, this guy made any Star-Wars villain look like a stuffed animal, if only Dune part 2 came out a few months earlier because Austin Butler would have for sure been a front runner for best supporting actor because he was just breath taking and defiantly a star in a bright room.With Austin Butler being my stand out actor I still have to mention Timothee Chalamet because again he was unbelievable on the same level as Austin Butler contrary to my earlier comments, what makes me believe this is the passion and anger in his voice was just bone chilling and almost any scene where he was ready to make a decision sent shivers down my spine because all of the plot was falling into place but it was just amplified that much more with incredible acting.Now with my actors concluded I must talk about the CGI and visual affects because Dune Part 2 would be little without them. All I can say is WOW!!! The visual affects made Star-wars and Avatar look cheap and that is saying something considering it had nowhere near as much funding and budget I mean even the scenes with the sand worms where perfect and could not look any more realistic but I can't leave it there because it doesn't stop there, the space ship although other worldly still looked like they where one hundred percent real. Dune Part 2 really was a stunning spectacle for the eyes.And for the best part of Dune Part 2, the cinematography was some of the best you will ever see in your life and I mean it no movie of film ever comes remotely near especially in the Si-Fi genre which speaks to how incredible Dune Part 2 is. Even the black and white shots looked stunning and sharper than a knife no matter what you end up watching this on it will still look beautiful. One scene in particular that stood out which was when Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler where fighting and the camara was set horizontally perpendicular to where they where fighting and the sun was symmetrical to the middle of the screen and the glare of the sun broke out into the audience, in short because I could talk about this one scene for hours , it was one of the greatest and most captivating scenes in any movie in history, truly amazing. There is so much more to cover with the cinematography but I don't have space or time but honestly you could watch Dune Part 2 just for the cinematography and you would be impressed.It doesn't matter if you believe in the prophesy or not because one thing I can say is that Dune Part 2 is a special movie and one that does not come by very often so it needs to be appreciated because there are so many factors that make this a perfect film on it's own and a perfect sequel because facing facts it is better than Dune Part 1 but it is also better than any other movie you will go and see this year, What I am trying to say is that it will take something very special to top Dune Part 2. And with that I cannot wait for Part 3 because I am sure they will do an even better job than what has already been done, goodbye and go and watch Dune Part 2 I implore you an easy 10 out of 10.",positive
863,"The acting was the first thing I applauded. It was very effective. The actors filled in the personalities of each character. Their overall tone of dialogue matched the motivations they had. Like how Lady Jessica is being more manipulative than ever. Rebecca Ferguson was a phenomenal actress. Zendaya also shined. Her character's desperation for saving Paul was heartbreaking, and she nailed the right emotions for Chani. And Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet is a very versatile actor. I love every movie he is into. The scene where he spoke to the Fremen underground as the Lisan al Gaib gave me chills, even though the movie felt hot.Second are the visual effects. As a cinephile who always looks for the visuals of a film, this movie outshined itself. It captured the whole environment depicted in the novel series. It was a breathtaking experience because it is quite rare to watch movies that were taken in a deserted place taking place in a different world. The appearance of the sandworm, or shai-hulud, made an impact. Its colossal magnitude shook the whole theater like I was there riding it. The scenes in Giedi Prime were cool, including the battle scene with Feyd. With its brutalist architecture and the monochrome color grading, it's so atmospheric.With the ability of Hans Zimmer to describe emotions through music, the score resonates with the mystique of the Dune universe. It triggers awe for something so unworldly, but mixed with a warning of imminent danger, it totally fits the movie's narrative.The writing also still landed. The great pacing connected it to the previous film and made a path for the movie's direction. I sat for 2 hours straight and never felt any boredom at all; it made me more excited. The build-up to the climax was crazy. Fleshing out new characters and adding them for more political turmoil and hindrances up to the final battle between Paul and Feyd, it was intense and menacing.The mixture of real-world cultures of Middle Eastern countries blends well with the theme of the movie, which was all about foreign colonizers using fear and faith as their tool to control. The theme made me question my reality. ""How are we going to believe?"" Are we just going to wait until a prophecy is fulfilled, or are we going to make it a reality? The movie warned me about the danger that a false belief could pose.Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, for carrying the new generation of sci-fi genre films and the whole of Hollywood itself. All the movies you have made have had an impact on me, which inspires me to be a filmmaker someday.",positive
864,"Very few movies live up to their pre-release hype. Dune does that and then some. This movie managed to exceed my expectations. I will be thinking about this movie for days, and will watch it again several more times. The last time a movie blew my mind like this was when the first Avatar came out in theaters, or the Dark Knight, or Braveheart. This movie ranks at the top of the list of the best movies of all time. The sound track by Hans Zimmerman is also amazing. It really moves your heart and emotions while watching the film. I've ordered the book now and can't wait to read it. Go see this movie in theaters before its digital release. You'll be glad you did.",positive
865,"Dune is my favorite novel of all time. I love it so much that David Lynch's version is enjoyable because of its incomprehensibility.I might be biased when I say Denis Villeneuve is probably the best modern director but i've thought that long before even Dune Part 1. Sicario was my first foray into his territory and it was astoundingly brilliant. Arrival and Blade Runner '49 both stuck with me for months. Dune Pt 1 set my expectations high.Pt 2 sticks that landing and then some. I wanted to see it again THE DAY after i saw it. Its epic, beautiful, well paced, and surprisingly funny. Its not that Marvel humor, its little jabs here and there that are a chuckle to add levity.Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is the standout character, being just unpredictably gruesome and loathsome and his pitch perfect imitation of Stellan Skarsgaard's voice for the Baron.",positive
866,"Very rare I hand out a 10/10 but honestly I can't find a single fault with this film, every aspect top to bottom is perfect. I could sit here for ages telling you about all the things that came together to make this film as great as it however I think I would be wasting your time. Instead all I am going to do is tell you to watch it because I can guarantee you this film will blow you away. My expectations going in were already really high and somehow this film exceeded them far behind I could even comprehend.Denis Villeneuve has just reached God level and I can very confidential sit him in the same category with the likes of Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, etc. Easily best film of the year and I will be extremely surprised if this one gets topped by end of the year.",positive
867,"I gonna be brief, after seeing this movie One thing I Know for sure, Villeneuve is not a good screenwriter, not at all.He is a m‚àö¬∞ster of visual time, due to the mature Of his visual skills a 3 hours movie feels fast, very easy to see, but even a child could wrote the dialogues of this movie, the story is full of blind spots...Also I've missed some room for the supernatural and mystical essence that is present into the original book...rest value to the movie.Remarkabl Javier Bardem and Austin Butler perfomings, both of then are the true pillars wich save somehow the story.A good film spectacle, not a m‚àö¬∞sterpiece.",positive
868,"Co-written and directed by Denis Villeneuve, the story takes place right after the end of part one in which Paul Atreides unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.It's kinda sad to remember that I am among those people who missed the opportunity to witness Dune: Part One in the theatres. However, I just watched it out of curiosity because it looked promising and I didn't have the slightest clue what it was all about. But what excites me about this kind of movie is that it'll always get better every time you watch it again. Things become much clearer and that's when I hop on the Dune bandwagon, the sequel is just two times better in terms of, well basically everything. It's kinda a privilege as a movie fan to get to experience a movie as immersive as this and Oppenheimer two years in a row. I guess this is what it feels like to live in the '90s, '80s, or even '70s when genre-defining movies are born, such as Star Wars (because it's the same genre).So basically Part One is just an introduction to all the characters, motives, the center of the story, etc. Though I'd say it is a fair introduction rather than perfect because as I said before, it's definitely not an easy watch for everyone especially those who never read the book. As for the sequel, it really is a perfect continuation that takes us right back into the story and explores more about why it all happened in the first place. Both Paul's and Jessica's development are written perfectly without overlapping and leaving the other one weak as a result. The performances of the actors and actresses were just perfect, they played their parts perfectly. Though his screen time is short, Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is definitely the one for me, he gave it all out and was completely unrecognizable.You know what, I'm out of words to describe just how good-looking this movie is from the technical standpoint. I'm just gonna say this, if you like the first one, you definitely gonna love this one.",positive
869,"I will keep it short just like the Harkonnen's in this movie. In the first one we saw their power and in the second one it felt like it was brushed off quickly. Like out of nowhere they beat them so easy and quickly. The movie in the beginning gave me the feeling that the cousin of the Baron was going to be this biggest "" bad guy "" where he will do such big evil things and be a big challenge for Paul. Which clearly he was not, and wasn't shown often. Even the Baron and Rabban was not shown often, expected more, they died too quickly and too easy. And I don't know if they had to keep the movie short, but I felt like they should have put more power and time in to the main characters. It went by way too fast in my opinion. Like they were in a rush. The first movie was nice and slow, intense and beautiful scenes. This one felt like a quickie. Paul received super powers immediately and had the emperor on his knees. An emperor which we barely saw, only had a few scenes we can count on one hand. Also at the end I expected a tougher battle, an emperor showing up with a few hundreds of soldiers, didn't make any sense, was so easy overthrown. They could have make it more exciting. I mean it wasn't a bad movie. It was enjoyable just very fast. They should have put at least half an hour or more in the film. And take their time with the characters, Paul's mother, the emperor, the Harkonnen's maybe some epic lines that Paul's father said in the previous one. More dialogue at the end. Didn't avenge his father enough. It was in and out. Anyways good movie, I hope the next one they will take their time more.",positive
870,"I read Dune shortly after it was published and have been a fan ever since, having read most of the canon.The first attempt at filming the book in 1984 was flawed, but I felt it was a valiant attempt.Dune Part 1 was not too bad and promised to be a reasonable version. It was missing some plot elements whose absence I couldn't really fathom (especially as there was a further three hours-worth to come) but I was willing to give them a pass on that pending the second part.Saw Part 2 yesterday, truly disappointing. Important elements missed out/distorted needlessly, flaws in the details/unlikely scenarios, and clear inaccuracies in the way some things were portrayed. There was plenty of the time that was devoted to big explosions etc that could have been better used in depicting the worthwhile missing aspects of the book.Definitely not recommended. To be honest I am not sure why I've given it two stars - maybe I just don't have it in me to downgrade something with Frank Herbert's name on it to the lowest possible grade.",negative
871,"This movie makes you believe that cinema is still alive. The overall styling, visuals, atmosphere are phenomenal. The storytelling, characters and music are nearing perfection, everything in the movie transpires attention to detail. Action and battle scenes are well balanced and it is never boring. Many of the scenes are truly unique and powerful. The movie has close to no defaults.This is an absolute must see for anyone that even remotely enjoys science fiction movies. I was on the edge of tears coming out of the screening room after such an epic display of cinema, like we rarely see anymore. Kudos to Denis Villeneuve, this is genius level.",negative
872,"Dune: Part Two is not what I expected. I went into this movie thinking it would be some sort of high octane action movie, but it really isn't. This movie prioritises the the technical side of cinema to grant the scale and profound meaning to the movie, and I love it. The music, the colours, the wide shots, it all crescendos to the perfect cliff hanger at the end, and unlike Part One, I felt fulfilled and satisfied with where this movie left it's characters.Throught this movie I felt a sense of awe in that I was witnessing cinema history before me. Usually, when I go to the cinema it's because I want to have a fun 2 hours out in town, but this movie felt like an occasion. Whilst it was fun, hell I would say it's some of the most fun i've had at the cinema, it was more. This movie really stood to show you what you can do with a camera, a script and some stunning vfx, and isn't this what the movies are for? It's artwork put into the big screen; Dune: Part Two, despite it's blockbuster nature is art, and this is why you need to go see it.",positive
873,"WOW! JUST WOW! Dune Parts 1 & 2 are the sci-fi epics we need in the modern day. Denis Villeneuve brought us Dune by Frank Herbert with such brilliance that I'm convinced he actually visited Arrakis. And I must eat humble pie since one of my few criticisms of Part One was the lack of Paul's visions. But Part Two really dives head first into this. Bringing Herbert's story of a false messiah to life.Speaking of bringing to life, here are my three favorite performances:1. Lady Jessica played by Rebecca Ferguson. Rebecca perfectly captured my favorite character from Dune. Nailing the loving mother and the scheming religious leader. It's unsurprising since she also made a fantastic bad guy in Doctor Sleep.2. Chani played by Zendaya. While Chani was a good character from the novel. Villeneuve's version has far more agency. Zendaya gives what I believe to be a career defining performance. Especially after Paul drinks The Water Of Life. It was heart-wrenching stuff, man. Kudos all around. Ô£ø√º√´√®3. Paul Atreides by Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet. After seeing Part One, I read Herbert's genre redefining novel. And I couldn't help but picture Timoth‚àö¬©e as Paul. Since the character description perfectly fits the actor. However, I wasn't sure if he could pull off the charismatic leader that he ended the novel as. Because I only saw him as the young man burdened by the weight of prophecy. But Chalamet delivers, and I would throw myself at a horde of Sardaukar for him. Usul Muad'Dib!In conclusion, Denis Villeneuve simultaneously honors the book and crafts an epic sci-fi action movie that anyone can enjoy. I also found it impressive how much I was still rooting for Paul, even when I knew where his story ended. There really is a power to film. Be well, fellow sci-fi guys. Long live the fighters!",positive
874,"Dune: Part One was my favourite movie of 2021. Originally slated to be released in November of last year, this second instalment was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. So it was with bated breath that I saw it last night in IMAX.Dune 2 is a masterpiece.It has been a very long time since a movie has left me speechless.It is Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus. Very much like how Christopher Nolan crowned his career with Oppenheimer last year, this is Villeneuve's greatest ever movie.Similar to Peter Jackson's, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Dune 2 represents another evolution of cinema as an art form. I don't use that word lightly.This is the true definition of a vice movie (see 4 Types of Movies tab at the top of homepage). The story locks you in from the opening frame and at just 15 minutes shy of 3 hours, this movie absolutely flies by, not once during it's runtime was I bored.The only downside is my cinema going adventure's of 2024 has peaked with Dune: Part Two, nothing will compare to this movie for the rest of the year.Let's have a Catch up...The story picks up literally in the same frame as part one ended. Dune: Part One and Dune: Part Two have to be seen as one movie split into two, this is not a sequel. If part one was the starter, this is the main course. It makes the first movie better.Paul Atreides (Chalamet) cements his position on Arrakis. He along with his mother Jessica (Ferguson) who herself becomes the Revered Mother start to foresee a prophecy that Paul or to give him is Fremen name Usul will become the saviour of the planet. To reflect this Paul gives himself the name of Muad'Dib, a powerful name on Arrakis.Meanwhile, after Baron Harkonnen continues to lose his grip on Arrakis thanks to the losses at the hands of those ""Rats"" the Freman and the incompetence of his unstable nephew Beast Rabben (Batista), the Baron calls his beloved other nephew Feyd-Rautha (Butler) up to the plate to re-take the planet in his families name and setting the scene for war.So, the best way to review this movie because of it's immensity is to break it down, here goes..CinematographyEvery aspect of how this movie looks is frankly staggering. DP Greig Fraser not only makes each frame look like a stunning photograph, his use of camera angles, lighting and the natural environment is amazing. The battle scenes are jaw dropping and the sense of scale, especially the sand worms in IMAX is eye watering. I had spine tingles for most of the movie.Sound and ScoreThe sound is incredible, as I saw it in IMAX (which I implore you to do if able) leaves you shaken in your seat. You will never forget where and when you first saw and heard those sand worms. The score by the legendary composer Hans Zimmer is equally superb and is used to amazing effect.CastAs for the cast, each member of the star studied line-up absolutely bring their A game to the table. This movie makes Timoth‚àö¬©e Chalamet a man. Gone is the petulant son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). I think Chalamet is fast becoming this generation's DiCaprio. Zendaya was equally superb as his partner Chiani, as she continues to show that she is one of the leading actresses of her geneartion.After his breakout role in Elvis (2022) and Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air (2024) Austin Butler is a revelation as the psychopathic Feyd-Rautha, beloved nephew to Baron Harkonnen.No Country for Old Men alum Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem resume their respective roles as Gurney Halleck and Stilgar offering gravitas and wise council to the younger cast who take centre stage.Florence Pugh as the emperors daughter Princess Irulan is excellent as is the great veteran actor Christopher Walken (In a small but pivotal role) as the Emperor.My only ""complaint"" as such is that Dave Batista's character Beast Rabben felt under served and was reduced to a bit of a one note character screaming out orders whilst slipping further out of the good graces of his uncle. On that subject, Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard) himself so central to the original film is also somewhat side lined in this second part of the movie.ActionWhilst I in no way shared this sentiment, there were some people who said Dune: Part One was boring and lacked action. The same cannot be said for this continuing instalment.The action in this movie is breathtakingly shot and choreographed. Whether it was wide scale battles or hand to hand combat it felt exhilarating, organic and primal.Special EffectsA seamless blend of top drawer CGI and jaw dropping practical effects. Effortlessly combined with filming on location in Abu Dhabi.Impact on CinemaDune: Part One and Dune: Part Two, is this generations Star Wars. It however goes further than that, it is Star Wars for grown-ups. There is nothing Disney has done with Star Wars to rival or even come close to Villeneuve's incredible movie. It makes the recent MCU and DC movies look what they are, light weight tensionless candy floss poop.What Villeneuve has achieved here is simply staggering.It reminds you of why the medium of cinema exists.It is a science fiction masterpiece.Denis Villeneuve and team deserve all the adulation, box office success and awards they can get.Verdict - Unmissable.",positive
875,"I never right reviews often but I just have to let this one out! This film is nothing but a masterpiece just like the first one, I'm so impressed with everything from Music, Acting, Cinematography, World/ Character Building is quite unique I can't say these sort of films come around often, but without the first film this would be very confusing to understand, I thought there would be more action or maybe the action scenes to have lasted a little bit longer.. but we can't win them all! Without question Dune part 1 & 2 are my favourite movies of all time I will watch them religiously till the day I die! And Part 3 :)",neutral
876,"(spoilers) Have been waiting awhile (over 2 years actually like everyone else) for director Villeneuve's continuation with Dune 2 and was not disappointed. 'Dune 2' is a formidable and at times spectacular cinema. I will say I liked its predecessor's pacing better than this one whose finale seemed a bit anti-climactic and off kilter. The stylized visuals give way to a cramped and dark-lit final set that seemed like a stage play oddly a bit out of place from some earlier beautiful, and intricate set designs.. Catching this on IMAX though was certainly worthwhile though. Javier Bardem fills in for the life and energy of the movie somewhat similar to Jason Momoa in the earlier film. Easily the best scene of the movie for me was the earlier fight scene with Harkonnen harvester, ground troops and Paul and Chani in serious battle , the fight choreography and melding of visual affects and sound was absoluately stunning and 1st rate putting even the Empire Strikes Back Hoth effects to shame. Was overall pleased with this entry and looking forward to Villeneuve's next picture, hopefully Science Fiction. Got the feelling more Dune will be on the way - looking forward to it. Give it a 7/10.",positive
877,"Just saw it a second time in IMAX.The first time I was blown away by the visuals, the aesthetics, the grandeur, and fascinated by the story.The second time I was blown away by the emotional weight of the story and its characters.Both times this film evoked strong emotions. At the risk of displaying recency bias, I feel comfortable putting this film in my top 10 films of all time.I will legitimately be sad when this movie leaves the theaters, specifically due to the tremendous nature of the IMAX experience. No home theater will be able to touch its scope and grandeur, I'm afraid.Take a bow, Denis. Take a bow.",neutral
878,"I'm not sure why I see all these posts calling for dune part 2 to be a masterpiece. Certainly it has the casting and production value to be great but upon watching it is such a let down compared to the first. As a director I love Denis Villeneuve but I feel like he's squandering his directorial might on dune. You can't just have amazing scenery and soundtrack without plot and scriptwriting to back it up which it does not. To me this is another indication that Hollywood has lost its way trending towards visuals over plot. I'm intrigued as to how they plan to salvage the franchise with part 3 but I think film enthusiasts need to be sceptical. How does a movie so lack lustre get such great reviews, review's that were better than the first? Are critics being paid off or are they brainwashed. Doesn't make much sense to me.",positive
879,"Am I the only one who found this movie flat? Yes, there is spectacle, but there's spectacle in transformers as well. This is by far Villeneuve's most ""marvel""-ish movie. I don't know how I can love the first part so much and just find the second part so utterly boring. It is so hard to CARE about any of the characters. And there was so, so much in the book that could (should?) have been used to make the plot more interesting. I'm really confused, because I was expecting a more canonic movie - with shifting alliances and a deeper dive into the mythology of the Bene Gesserit. Alia's part was a joke, it was just such a gimmick where I'm the book it's so, so essential to the overarching conflict between the Atreides / Kwisatz Gaderach and Bene Gesserit factions. There was so much there! This version for me was way too streamlined. I'm glad everyone else liked it though.",positive
880,"I think we are really lucky to be living in a time where we can witness such a greatness of a movie. This was a masterpiece, everything was incredible, the cinematography, the dialogue, this story with Paul and the fremen, arrakis, the acting was outstanding and for me it's a oscar worthy performance from Thimoth√©e Chalamet. For me it's the best movie of the decade, if not the best movie of all time!!! The score is incredible, every sound effect makes the movie epic, and the score for me is one of the things that makes this movie so good aswell. If you like a world where they have their on language, where actors give it their all with a touching and epic story with loads of action and good dialogue, go watch it please!!",positive
881,"When I saw the first movie I could tell it was many used to build up to this one and it showed. Dune 2 is one of my favorite movies, it could just be that I love sci-fi, but there is really nothing to complain about. My favorite movie is Interstellar, even though this movie is very different; they both involve space and I love the genre. A strongpoint of this movie is the soundtrack and cinematography. Which is also a strongpoint of Interstellar. I will probably see this movie many more times on streaming. I will also see Dune: Messiah as soon as it comes out. I totally recommend this movie to anyone.",positive
882,"I went into this movie thinking Dune Part One was a masterpiece so I already knew I'd love this film. Dune Part Two took everything people liked in the first one and multiplied it x1000. This must have been what people felt like walking out of Star Wars in 1977. This is our generation's Star Wars. Denis Villeneuve is a technical genius and I loved everything about this film. The world building in this one is even better than the first, the cinematography somehow got even better, the acting is top tier, but once again what shines the most is the score. Hearing that music again but this time on the silver screen was a feeling that won't be replicated in a long while. Walking out of this movie I felt like I was Paul Muad'dib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis. This is what movies are made for. My hopes are through the roof for Dune Messiah. To all those who have yet to experience this masterpiece, may you enjoy as I did and may thy knife chip and shatter.",positive
883,"Dune 2 proved to be a sublime continuation of the captivating narrative that left me hanging after the first installment. The storytelling in this sequel reached new heights, seamlessly weaving complex characters, political intrigue, and profound conflicts. Each plot twist was meticulously crafted, keeping me enthralled and engaged from start to finish. The film delved deeper into the intricacies of the Dune universe, delivering a rich and immersive experience that truly satisfied the cravings of fans eagerly awaiting more from Frank Herbert's masterpiece.What truly set Dune 2 apart, however, was its visual spectacle. The film showcased breathtaking landscapes of Arrakis and introduced intricately designed sandworms that were nothing short of awe-inspiring. The meticulous attention to detail, combined with cutting-edge cinematography, brought the Dune world to life in ways that exceeded my expectations. The visual prowess of the movie, particularly during the exhilarating scenes where the Fremen and House Atreides orchestrated a meticulously coordinated assault, unleashing a symphony of destruction from every conceivable angle. This almost compelled me to rise from my seat in sheer excitement. Dune 2 not only met but surpassed expectations, setting an exceptionally high standard for the future of the franchise.",neutral
884,"From the moment the opening credits rolled, it was clear that ""Dune Part Two"" wasn't just a continuation-it was a transcendental elevation of the saga. Director Denis Villeneuve has outdone himself, weaving a tapestry so rich in detail and emotion that it's hard not to be completely engulfed by the world of Arrakis.The narrative depth in this sequel is profound, striking a perfect balance between the political intrigue, personal vendettas, and the overarching battle for control of the spice. The storytelling is nuanced, with each character's journey feeling both intimate and monumental in the grand scheme of the Dune universe. Timoth√©e Chalamet's return as Paul Atreides is nothing short of mesmerizing. His portrayal of Paul's evolution from a boy burdened by prophecy to a leader embroiled in desert warfare is executed with a depth and vulnerability that's rarely seen in science fiction epics.The newcomers to the cast bring fresh dynamics that enhance the story in unexpected ways, blending seamlessly with the returning ensemble to create a rich tapestry of characters. Zendaya's Chani is given much more room to shine, offering a poignant and fierce performance that stands as the emotional core of the film.Visually, ""Dune Part Two"" is a feast for the senses. The cinematography captures the vast, unforgiving landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking beauty, while the set designs and costumes further immerse the audience in this otherworldly experience. The action sequences are choreographed with a clarity and scale that surpass the already high bar set by the first film, making every battle both a spectacle and a crucial piece of the narrative puzzle.Hans Zimmer's score, once again, elevates the film to new heights. His compositions blend.",neutral
885,"Absolutely stunning film and story this is film making at its best, this is where Hollywood should be not trying to brainwash audiences but just telling amazing stories with brilliant performances from all the actors. From edge of your seat fight scenes with brilliant choreography, to passion you can't feel between characters. And of course bringing drama and emotion excellent work by Hanz Zimmer on the sound track.Disney take notes this is the expectations the people have of genre like Star Wars Change your direction remake and remould what you have messed up but do not presume you will make money by buying up brands and twisting it to be an agenda you will lose again to classics like Dune.",positive
886,"I loved Villeneuve's 'Blade Runner 2049' but I found his Dune parts 1 and 2 extremely difficult to enjoy, despite the impressive photography. The main issue for me lies in the lack of a relatable protagonist. Timoth√©e Chalamet's acting is great but he is not charismatic in the role of Paul. This affects the way we, the audience, are (un)able to empathise with the protagonist and his narrative arc. The only character in Villeneuve's take on Dune I liked was Jason Momoa's incarnation of Duncan in Part 1.Like many others, I wanted to like this but I could not. This prompted me to rewatch Lynch's Dune (1984), a masterpiece in disarray, quoting the title of M. Evry's excellent book, a film broken during editing and post-production by Universal and De Laurentiis. In spite of its many flaws, the theatrical cut has so much vision, a unique vibe, and a spectacular soundtrack that makes for a much more enjoyable watch.If we could have access to the original, 4-hour cut as intended by Lynch, what a gift to mankind that would be!",positive
887,"12/10: The story line is so emotionally impactful.I was genuinely moved by this film.Please bring us more of this series. I loved it so much.The sound and special effects make this movie exceptional. The editing was nothing I have ever seen before; pure magic.It enhances the first version tremendously and is in my opinion, better than the first.This movie is in my top 3 movies of all time. That is verrrry difficult.I wish 10 of these movies could come in a series. It's definitely a new starwars, and in my Gen Z mind, better. I brought 20 of my friends to watch It and we were all astonished because we definitely underestimated it haha.",positive
888,"Let's start with the good, the imagery is absolutely stunning.The desert views, the world, the fremens, the harkonens WOW.The worm riding scene is particularly impressive, the combination of action, visuals and sound is visceral.The sound - for those not so few - like myself who thought the Academy mistakenly awarded the Oscar instead of the Razzie for the sound of Dune 2021 - good news. Villeneuve reigns in the noise and does a pretty good job with it this time.No longer a distraction, the soundtrack builds and blends with the scenery masterfully. That's how it's done, Denis.Well, enough with the good.The character development, aside from Paul and Chani, is altogether lacking. Jessica and Stilgar get some screen time, just to give the barest support the origin storyline. The Harkonnens (though rendered beautifully) are not just unidimensional. Vileneuve practically comes out and spells ""Unidimensional"" in black and white letters. Yes, they're brutes, we get it.The storyline is pretty much a mediocre love story. It's nice, not terrible, but it's just that. As a stand alone, it is an enjoyable - enough watch. But that's about it...Villeneuve puts very little effort into exploring the complexity of the Dune world and that of Kwisatz Haderach.And here comes the missed opportunities.The original Dune is, by some measure the origin story of being with the power to bring space and time together. A superhuman, a demigod. A story of intrigue and plotting and plans within plans within plans.But Villeneuve's is a lackluster story of a a sort of fortune teller conning a few fundamentalists into following him.There is no awe - aside from that inspired by the visuals. And as result, there is no way to properly end this story.Unable to lean on the CGI, and unsupported by the underdeveloped story line, the final falls flat.""I remember your Gom Jabbar. You remember Mine. I can kill you with one word"" Paul should have said. Words that could have sent a shiver down the viewer's spine.But perhaps, Villeneuve chose the pathetic ""Silence"" to avoid the viewer's puzzled looks. Remembert the What? What's Bene Gesserit anyway?In summary, this is not a masterpiece, but it's a decent movie with great visuals. Better than the 1st one, that's for sure.It could have been far better if Villeneuve managed to explore Paul becoming the Kwisatz Haderach...",positive
889,"How this got it's 12A rating is a miracle. The film has war obviously as it's central theme, but it moves away from your traditional battle scenes with some really dark and unnecessary killings. Strangely enough I felt uneasy and creeped out by the religious tone of the film. It felt very close watching a film about an evil cult. This movie doesn't flow, it's disjointed and unrealistic. I learned nothing and felt tricked that the story still hadn't ended. I didn't enjoy this film at all. Zendaya spends nearly every scene gurning for the camera. Timothee isn't convincing as a strong man to lead or fight. Rebecca is just pouting all the time and creepy as hell. Josh brolin has about 5 minutes of dialogue. Christopher is being propped up by a stick. I could go on but I won't.",neutral
890,Truly epic film. Reminds you of why we love the movies and the movie theater. Not since the first Dune have a seen a film so big it reminds you of old Hollywood and the movie events it used to produce. Find the biggest theatre with the best sound quality and enjoy an amazing experience. The books are very complex but Denis translated it to the screen brilliantly. Hans Zimmerman delivered again with a soundtrack you feel in your bones. Every actor brought their A game and brought you into the story. Deserves a third installment to keep the story going. Already reserved tickets to go back next weekend and see it again.,positive
891,"I watched this in Imax, and it was sensationel all. I was worried i had too High expectations for the movie but still i was completely blown away. Everything is perfect. The acting, the sounds, the Music the character development in part 2 is insanely good. I liked all the movie but the end was the best part for me, the raised flags of Atreides, the final fight the SILENCE. Loved it all. The casting is also perfect and you could feel the improvement of the characters in part 2.I Think it was the first time i was in a Cinema and everyone started clapping at the end. ( the Cinema was completely sold out)
Great stuff guys keep it Coming.",positive
892,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 delivers epic spectacle that will leave you breathless. For fans longing for the grandeur of Game of Thrones and the sweeping scale of Lord of the Rings, Dune 2 fulfills that desire in a way that evokes genuine awe. Villeneuve's masterful world-building and stunning visuals create a cinematic experience that rivals the best fantasy epics. The story itself is rich with complex characters and political intrigue, reminiscent of the captivating drama that unfolded in Westeros. This is a film that transcends genre, offering a compelling narrative interwoven with stunning visuals. Dune 2 is a must-see for any discerning filmgoer seeking a truly immersive cinematic experience.",positive
893,"I was blown away by the sheer power and efficiency of the storyline in this film. Unlike its predecessor, which occasionally felt dragged out, every scene in this sequel felt vital and impactful. The dialogue crackled with intensity, leaving me inspired and moved.Managing character development in a film with a large ensemble cast can be a daunting task, but here it was executed flawlessly. Each main and supporting character brought something unique to the table, enriching the narrative and adding depth to the story.From the seamless editing to the captivating score, the stunning cinematography to the exceptional acting, every aspect of this film was executed to perfection. Watching it in IMAX only heightened the experience, elevating it to a whole new level of cinematic brilliance.In short, this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I wholeheartedly recommend experiencing it on the biggest screen possible to fully appreciate its grandeur and impact.",neutral
894,"An entertaining movie in a current industry that has little entertainment coming out of it. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not preach or shove agendas down our throats or think of us as stupid. Watch the film, you'll enjoy it. The story differs slightly from the novel as it's impossible to put a book direct to movie. Denis was true to heart and true to the source material. The actors did very well. The story was tight and even my mother who has no idea about the source material was able to understand what was going on and really loved the son daughter relationship between Paul and jessica. Please make dune messiah.",positive
895,"This complex story was simplified, an achievement in itself. Eliminated the right things and enhanced the right things. I can tell this work of art came from a true fan of the books.Some scenes I felt were better done than the book itself. Especially how he proves it to the council that he is the true messiah. I enjoyed the books and this movie just makes the books better for me.The changes with the story of Paul and Chani leaves a bit if unpredictability for the people who have already read the book. The way he chooses to take the water of life is also fresh for the fans of the book.Dennis might truly be able to take on the challenge of creating the God Emperor books as well.",positive
896,"I loved part 1, but expected more from this movie. While it maintains the excellent atmosphere and almost everyone does a fine job acting, there are a few inexplicable story changes that hurt this movie:No navigators. Really? The reason Dune is the most important planet in the universe, and you can't be bothered to put them in the movie? Not cool.No weirding training. This is the main thing that makes Paul so important to the Fremen, and it's completely left out. Why?Chani dumps Paul. WTF? This is exactly the opposite of the book. How are they going to have the Leto boys be born for part 3 with this nonsense?Zendaya. She alternates between looking unreasonably angry and way too goofy. Seriously, why does she get roles? Also, this is the second character she has robbed of red hair, MJ being the first. Un-effing-forgivable.I wanted to like this more, and maybe I will after watching it again, but it just missed the mark.-1 for absence of navigators
-1 for weirding training omission
-.5 for Chani turning on Paul
-.5 for miscasting ChaniFinal grade: 7.",positive
897,"There were only three things I didn't like. Christopher Walken was horribly miscast; it was like he was dropped in from another movie. All I could see was Christopher Walken, not the character he was portraying. The second miscast was Florence Pugh; it just seems like she's in everything right now, which is probably why I have Pugh fatigue. With her performance, she also seemed a little outside of the Dune universe. Lastly, Glossu Harkonnen got a wicked nerf bat in Part 2, which was a tad strange; in the first, he was perceived as brutal and fearless, and in Part 2, he was a coward and a screw-up. Besides those three critiques, the movie itself was fantastic.",positive
898,"I found the film entertaining, but was disappointed at the lack of acting. What is the purpose of having a renowned character actor like Christopher Walken, who can captivate his audience with his oratory performances, and not giving him lines to recite? Most of the actress's faces are hidden behind face veils making it almost impossible to see who is really doing the acting. When we do see their faces, we can see nose, eyes and mouth and they are covered by a veil which only allows a shadow of the persons face viewable to the audience. The movie goes to great lengths to de-glamorize the physical beauty of a mature female by covering up all defining physical attributes with outer wear that is similar to Middle Eastern desert dress. The fighting scenes tend to be bloodless, in fact almost all the blood is replace with water or blue stuff. It seems this film went to the extremes to comply with the PG-13 rating. Why? The strange thing about the film is how it relates to religious fanatics and war and in the end we have a holy war. Why? Seems the whole fuss was about the blue stuff and nothing to do with religion, except for the fact that the blue stuffs home planet is populated by a very religious majority. The root cause from all the fighting is the pursuit of power and wealth that comes from controlling the blue stuff. So why not just tell the story from the point of view of a greed and power struggle and give: the actors some decent line to recite, not covering up the females and their physical beauty, show some blood in the fighting and maybe some intimate love making might help? Bottom line is that you can only look at a sea of sand for so long, and three hours is way over my limit.",positive
899,"First one was mildly ( mildly ) watchable. But this was a true celluloid abomination. They must've pumped some narcotic gas in the theatres for the praise this absolute slogfest received. I almost went to the theatre and mercifully I didn't because I would have been scarred for life. Rarely have I seen a movie as boring and uneventful as this. A few scattered action scenes that are mostly over before they begin, drab costumes and two of the worst leads in many a moon. Chalamet and Zendaya are horribly miscasted as Jack Skelington and Olive Oil and are so pathetic looking with their emaciated forms as to be disturbing. The uninspired effects ( except for some grand wide shots ) are a joke. And to think think people came down hard on the masterpieces Rebel Moon two parter and not this. This generations Empire Strikes Back?? LOL. More like this generations Flash Gordon only less entertaining. When Jack, uh I mean Paul walks up the hill in his 80 pound physique to inspire his troops is truly one of the most silliest and laughable scenes in movie history. Second is his fight with Feyd. How did he win after being heavily wounded and already looking like a corpse. Villanueve as usual directs so lifelessly that they should promote his movies as true cures for insomnia. I didn't even know the supremely talented Hans Zimmer produced the somnolent, screeching music till after. This film is a true travesty and a shocking reminder that truly terrible movies are still being made. Avoid like the plague.",negative
900,"After watching part 1 over & over, patiently waiting for this release, I can say I was completely mesmerized, from the cinematography, to the sound, to the plots & thrills, we were blown away. I had high expectations & this ticked every box.A few deviations from the book, like most movies have but replaced with nothing short of great rewrites!My better half can barely sit through a 30 minute episode, he couldn't take his eyes off the big screen & claimed it the best movie he has ever seenIt's a must watch & I truly hope some awards go up for grabs for the visually pleasing & immersive film!!",positive
901,"One of the best movies I've ever seen honestly. 10/10 in acting, pacing, cinematography, soundtrack, visual effects, and storyline. This will go down as one of the greatest films of all time, especially in scifi. This is peak filmmaking. With such a long runtime, I was pleasantly surprised that each scene was direct and meaningful to the plot, no fluff at all, and just helping build up the action, emotions, and world. It's always great when directors trust the audience's intelligence.Timothee Chalamet's acting was so powerful for such a young and skinny boy. I was on the edge of my seat, especially in his religious leader moments. The cast was nothing short of incredible.",positive
902,"Hype is such a dangerous thing as it opens the door to tremedous let down. Denis Villeneuves opus is the polar opposite. Beyond expectations is what he and his amazing team have achieved. The Godfather 2 of Dune.. Even better than the first. What struck me so often in this film was though the Dune Novels was the inspiration for so many Syfy stories, novels, films you would expect some amount of.. ""oh I have seen that before"" but in Villeneuve's hands, he delivers originality. I expect the film will do to Films what the Books originally did. Its a master class. It there is any thing to criticize, is the jumps in the story from time to time... But it doesnt matter...because the blanks get filled in. Just like a torture scene or love scene where, not everything is shown... Ur imagination is allowed to do the rest. As for Hans Zimmer's score. Oscar in the bag. He has once again raised the bar on the word Epic. This film is going to walk away with every award for score and sound editing, and Cinematography.",positive
903,"This movie is absolutely breathtaking from start to finish, the character development is incredible. The depth of the movie is fantastic, you can feel like you are part of something big and you can see the power of words. Plenty of great references to human history. Denis Villeneuve is building a great legacy. This trilogy will probably beat lord of the ring as the best trilogy ever made. The only bad thing about this movie is that now we need to wait to see the third one. Hopefully this box office success will change Denis Villeneuve mind on waiting a while to produce the third one and decide to go on the project right away.",positive
904,"This is simply one of the best movies made of all time and for numerous reasons.The sound and music enhance the visuals as much as D1 and continue in the same vein. From the Arab-esque singing from the firemen to the throaty rattles of the bad guys. Bonus points awarded for actually making the talking levels of suitable standard for humans. No mumbling dialogue anywhere.How do you make sand look so stunning? At times like an ocean vista, calm and sprawling. Others a sea in full anger and rage. Never dull imagery.I'm not a fan of films too long but this absolutely flew by. No gaps. No fillers. Just a story motoring along at a pace that brings you with it without any confusion.The characters develop steadily in tangent with the story. I can't find any fault.",positive
905,"I have never written any reviews for a movie ever, but I must say Dune part 2 was the best movie I had the pleasure to watch in cinema. It was like they premiered the movie before and collected all the critics and mistakes they have done and then they remade the movie. It's that good. The acting, MUSIC, fight scenes, cinematography, the world building and the characters were well thought,everything was on point. I really don't know if they can top this with part 3 and if they do, this would be the best trilogy of all time. To anyone who wants to wait to watch it in their homes, just dont, this movie is crafted for IMAX. This is indeed peak cinema.",positive
906,"A beautifully directed film that suffers from a lot of boring and mumbled dialogue. Part One was a great film, almost perfect. It did all the heavy lifting of setting the scene and world building that should have allowed Part Two to just get on with things. However we spend the first hour of this film explaining to the audience what is going on, and even then it's baffling to most who haven't read the books.The acting is great throughout and the cinematography is some of the best you'll ever see, as you would expect from Denis but it just doesn't make up for the pacing and dialogue which fall short in this one.",positive
907,"It's rare to feel this engaged watching a movie these days. This is old school cinema, like Dances with Wolves or Lawrence of Arabia, lengthy movies that never get boring and leave you on the edge of your seat and a sense of awe! I'm a biiiig fan of Dune. I loved the Lynch movie, read all the books and even watched the equally terrible and underrated sci-fi series, but this movie (Dune and Dune part 2) brought what I imagened in my head all these years to life. Kudos to the casting, all incredible and absolutely perfect, although Javier Bardem and Austin Butler clearly stole the show in this second part. Now I just hope they keep going, the story is far from over. Enjoy and watch it in IMAX if possible!",positive
908,"The first movie was visually stunning but boring as hell. So basically, the second one was marketed as a masterpiece, best sci-fi movie ever by critics and even compared to best Star Wars movies.Is it a masterpiece? Or did we watch the same story before in many forms? Matrix maybe? Prophecies, chosen ones and dreams offer same type of premises.Austin Butler's villian portrayal is nowhere close to Ledger's Joker or Bardem's Chigurh but still PRed agressively as so. Chalamet is a big OK as protagonist. Zendaya is the weakest part actingwise and her California accent doesn't help the spice planet. Villeneuve's directing is maybe flawless but still relies way too much on visual and sound. Zimmer's soundtrack is intense and original as always lifting up scenes one level.The only difference between Dune and Rebel Moon are a better director and fat studio budget in real. Is it good? Yes, it is but a 7/10 at max. Nothing more.",positive
909,"No seriously, didn't understand any of it.Four of us watched, none of us read the books etc, yet all four of us took turns basically every 15 minutes to ask ""is anyone understanding this?"".It's up there with probably the worst example of cinematic storytelling. As if the director assumed there was no need to explain the incredibly complex parts to the story and not only that, introduced new complexities in such regular fashion that it was simply impossible to keep up.As others have said, it was quite simply boring. Also, basically monochrome or better yet, sepia tone. Entire movie was purposefully shot in sand tones. No, it didn't feel ""immersive"", just magnified the dull experience.Acting was also very poor but I'm not focusing there as it's really hard to truly evaluate when you've got no idea what they are talking about to judge how they deliver it.",negative
910,"I am floored with the production value of the whole film. Every shot looks amazing, the sound design and score are flawless, the script is a masterclass in writing (there is SO much exposition that needs to happen that doesn't feel like exposition at all). Performances, effects, sets, costuming, everything is immaculate. I was seriously worried I would set my expectations too high seeing early reviews and I'd be let down but NO.Even the major changes it makes in adapting the source material only serve to keep the focus of the movie tighter and keeps the pacing of the movie where it needs to be. Every decision feels thought out and very deliberate.If someone can hand deliver a copy of ""The Way of Kings"" to Denis Villanueve I will venmo you.",positive
911,"Dune Part 2 delivers a cinematic spectacle like no other. Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends boundaries, crafting an instant classic that immerses viewers in a universe beyond imagination. The film's grand scale and breathtaking visuals set a new standard for epic storytelling. From the very beginning, you're drawn into a world where characters and their identities are expertly primed, making for a deeply engaging narrative.What truly sets Dune Part 2 apart is its ability to blend depth, scale, drama, spectacle and humor, creating a movie experience that resonates with adult audiences seeking substance and sophistication. It's a refreshing departure from the formulaic tropes of frequent franchises and Hollywood blockbusters, offering a polished cinematic gem destined to withstand the test of time.The sound design is nothing short of extraordinary, with Hans Zimmer's score elevating every scene to new heights. After watching, you're left with an exhilarating sensation akin to finishing a thrilling ride, a testament to the film's immersive power. Dune Part 2 stands as a remarkable achievement, a cinematic masterpiece that boldly challenges recent Disney productions.Prepare to be mesmerized, as this is a movie you'll want to experience again and again. Dune Part 2 is a triumph in every sense of the word.Thank you Denis for this masterpiece √∞≈∏‚Äô¬Ø",neutral
912,"This Film Is very Good.We Need it to Improve the Hollywood Cinema in the Top of Cinema. The first half of Dune: Part Two is among the best things that Villeneuve has ever done, though the sheer eventfulness of the plot and a bustling retinue of side-players (Austin Butler upgrading Sting's cod-pieced ninny from the 1984 film into a hairless psychopath is worthy of mention) means that the final act does feel rushed.Dune: Part Two is certainly up there with some of the best science fiction movies I've ever seen.Villeneuve's facility with this stuff doesn't just come from his talent for spectacle, though there are set pieces in Dune: Part Two that aim to blow the top of your skull off.",positive
913,"Finally a necessary sequel that surpasses the original on a huge scale.A masterclass in filmmaking by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings the complex universe of Dune to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.The cinematography is a visual feast, with beautiful desert landscapes that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.Furthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer elevates the entire experience, perfectly complimenting the grandeur of the narrative.Dune part 2 is a cinematic triumph, a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece of cinema history.",neutral
914,"A great movie to see at the theater. This gigantic visual spectacle features some characters you know from the first film and some interesting new ones, including Christopher Walken. It is visually stunning, dark, complex, and draws from great cinema and deep historical references of the past of human history. We saw it in IMAX which is well worth it. This film is definitely want to see in the theater and you should not wait to watch on a television. You will only get about half the effect on a TV screen. That said, the film was a bit long, and despite a few slow moments, it kept us fully engaged, and felt and thrallingly real, despite its other-worldly characters and planets. Truly, an inspiring piece of cinema, the captures, both the human spirit, the conflict of humanity, the flaws of emotion, and the goodness of the human spirit. Great Cinematic classic!",positive
915,"Dune 2, crafted by the visionary Denis Villeneuve, is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, this epic sci-fi saga transports audiences to a breathtaking universe filled with rich lore, stunning visuals, and unforgettable performances. Villeneuve's masterful direction ensures every frame is meticulously crafted, immersing viewers in the intricate world of Arrakis and its compelling characters. The stellar cast, led by Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet and Zendaya, delivers powerhouse performances that breathe life into Frank Herbert's iconic characters. From its sweeping desert landscapes to its awe-inspiring set designs, every aspect of Dune 2 is a testament to Villeneuve's unparalleled talent and dedication to his craft. With its gripping storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and immersive world-building, Dune 2 cements itself as a modern sci-fi masterpiece that will leave audiences in awe for years to come.",neutral
916,"The movie we waited for and been hyped for did not disappoint when it comes to cinematography. Visually 10/10, it makes you live in the Dune universe. And then once you're in it, you wait for the plot to build up. Which they tried doing but never really even scratched the full potential of the characters or the abilities of this brilliant cast. The conversations were choppy, the emotions were shallow, the viewer couldn't really connect to any of the character's emotions or journey. Let alone those of Paul. Me as a viewer couldn't emotionally attach to Chani & Paul's love. It was only introduced briefly here and there while we are actually being focused on Paul's emotional growth/development journey. Also, with such a heavy press tour & the background that was given to the viewer that Zendaya & Timothy are best friend in real life, it was even harder to feel their on screen chemistry.",positive
917,"There is not many near 3 hour films I could sit through and stay not only entertained but totally connected to the story. This film went beyond my expectations. It is hard sometimes making a sequel and living up to the first movie but it did just that. I totally agree with the Director that you could watch the second installment without watching the first but you would be missing out. Everything from the cinematography, sound, music to the story itself, I was awestruck by the finished product. Though the film does start out slow, it quickly picks up and runs with it. I very much look forward to part 3 as it leaves you with much more to the adventure still to be told. In my opinion, this is by far one of the greatest films I have seen in recent years.",positive
918,"OK, this was very well made, acted and filmed and I enjoyed it even though, like many other viewers, I knew the story having seen other versions that were made. The acting was good, the effects were excellent and the design of the buildings, flying machines, etc were
really imaginative....but why so many dark interior scenes? Didn't they invent a light bulb in that future world?? So many scenes where I was squinting to see who was who and what they were doing. Why spend millions making an excellent movie and then hide everything in darkness and shadow???? Maybe it sounds petty, but it spoiled the movie for me. I guess the director didn't want to make a shiny cute Star Wars kind of future world., and I get that, but I really felt disappointed that so much was hidden from view just to create a mood or atmosphere.",positive
919,"I don't believe it.I don't believe that the rating for this movie is that high.How?This movie is OK. Not great but OK and I refuse to believe that the amount of 10/10s are authentic.The battle scenes make little sense (why are so many people using swords when THEY CAN AND DO just shoot each other?).The Harkonen make Storm Troopers from Star Wars look like master fighters, as do the ""feared"" Sardukar. They are often just brushed aside and no challenge whatsoever.Chani is unlikeable towards the end of the film as is Paul.The Baron and most of his family are defeated super easily as is the Emperor (who was cast poorly).How were these clowns in power for so long? The only good fight they put up is one Paul needs to invite rather than be subjected to.The movie spent too long on certain parts and rushed the end.It was a disappointing ""OK movie"".We are living in a world of make-believe if this is ""a masterpiece"".",positive
920,"This Movie is something really special. Of course it is a strange Journey on strange planets, but there is so much humanity and exestentialism involved, it becomes a very universal story.This Story, the score and the cinemateography is pure poetry from beginning to end. Denis Villeneuve stepped up his craft in a major way, exceeding already enormous expextations and creating Images no one has ever seen. It is a landmark in movie making that has to be experienced in a cinema.The cast gives amazing performances, but Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet, Zendaya and Austin Butler are the stand outs of the movie.10/10.",positive

Absolutely beautifull and the wait for the last part of the triology, which release Will be in 2028 at his best, will be sweet torture. And please let Austin Butler become a bold goth, God he is sexy as hell in this masterpiece. I am prettig sure i will Watch it over and over. Untill part three is there anyway.",positive
922,"""Dune: Part Two"" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, encapsulating the essence of Frank Herbert's classic with an execution that can only be described as visually and auditorially mesmerizing. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends the confines of traditional science fiction, elevating this film into a realm of unparalleled immersion, where the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the intricate complexities of Herbert's universe are brought to life with staggering clarity and emotional depth.The visuals in ""Dune: Part Two"" are nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve, along with cinematographer Greig Fraser, crafts a visual palette that is as vast and sweeping as the dunes themselves. Each frame is a meticulously designed masterpiece, capturing the stark beauty of the desert landscape, the opulence of the imperial court, and the visceral intensity of the Fremen's struggle. The use of practical effects, augmented by judicious CGI, creates a tactile realism that grounds the story's fantastical elements in a palpable reality. The sweeping shots of Arrakis's desert, the intricate designs of the spaceships and technology, and the hauntingly beautiful Sietches of the Fremen are rendered with such detail and care that they become characters in their own right.Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals to create an immersive experience that is truly extraordinary. His music for ""Dune: Part Two"" is both haunting and evocative, weaving traditional Middle Eastern motifs with futuristic synths to underscore the film's themes of destiny, power, and transformation. The score ebbs and flows with the narrative, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments, from the thunderous clashes of battle to the intimate whispers of prophecy. Zimmer's ability to capture the soul of Herbert's universe in his compositions adds a layer of depth to the film that transcends the visual spectacle, ensnaring the audience in a sensory embrace that is both exhilarating and deeply moving.For fans of the original novels, ""Dune: Part Two"" offers a nuanced interpretation of Paul Atreides' journey that both honors and challenges Herbert's intentions. In the books, particularly in ""Dune Messiah,"" Herbert sought to subvert the traditional hero's journey by presenting Paul as a deeply flawed figure, whose rise to power brings about not salvation but suffering. This film bravely embraces that complexity, depicting Paul not as the unblemished hero many have come to expect but as a young man grappling with the weight of prophecy, the seductions of power, and the moral ambiguities of his actions.This portrayal of Paul is a bold narrative choice, reflecting a deeper understanding of Herbert's critique of the hero myth. By emphasizing Paul's darker impulses and the consequences of his decisions, ""Dune: Part Two"" challenges viewers to reconsider their perceptions of leadership, heroism, and destiny. It's a testament to Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet's performance that Paul remains a compelling, if increasingly troubled, protagonist. Chalamet captures the internal conflict of a character caught between destiny and desire, bringing a nuanced depth to Paul that is both captivating and unsettling.The decision to delve into the darker aspects of Paul's character aligns with Herbert's own reflections on the misinterpretation of ""Dune."" Herbert was concerned that readers glorified Paul as a hero, missing the cautionary tale of power and its pitfalls. This film rectifies that, presenting a vision of Paul that is more in line with Herbert's intentions, and in doing so, enriches the narrative with complexity and ambiguity.""Dune: Part Two"" is a masterful continuation of Villeneuve's adaptation, a film that not only captures the grandeur and majesty of Herbert's universe but also engages with its most challenging themes. The combination of stunning visuals, a captivating score, and a willingness to explore the moral complexities of its protagonist makes this film a remarkable achievement. It's a cinematic experience that not only entertains but also invites reflection on the nature of power, heroism, and the human condition, solidifying its place as a landmark in science fiction filmmaking.",positive
923,"I never leave reviews, but this film is absolutely fantastic. It's convinced me to express it's beauty and get as many eyes on it as possible. From it's stunning visuals to its beautiful audio the movie exceeds it all. The fight choreography is nothing short of perfect, the dialogue feels like actual dialogue and the performances are all fun. It is genuinely one of the best movies I have ever seen. I could talk about how perfect this movie is for hours on end and I did after it ended.Do yourself a favour, don't watch this at home, go to the cinema if you can. It's an experience I recommend for everything.",positive
924,"This is a simple and short review: 'Go see this movie, in the theatre if possible and on a very big screen. We both loved it.'We spent the last week in Khao Lak (heaven), but the week before, we watched ""Dune Part 1"" and then saw ""Part 2"" in the theatre on the day it opened. It was grand and epic storytelling on a scale I've not seen in ages. Both ""Dune"" movies are transportive like ""Titanic"" in 1998 and the original ""Avatar"" in 2009 (which I saw four times, including once at the Chinese Theatre). I've not read any of the ""Dune"" books, but I was able to grok what was going on (mainly), and while I haven't always been a Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet fan, he was excellent here, as was Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, and many others. Everything about the movie is epic and it's well worth a cinema visit.",positive
925,"This... is cinema at its finest.Just watched Dune Part Two in an IMAX theater, and it was inarguably the best cinematic, spiritual experience I've ever had. As a fan of the novels, I am in awe of how the characters from the second half of Dune (1965) comes to life with the stellar cast.Denis's storytelling was on point - the religious aspect and the Fremen culture in particular resonated with me the most since Part One. From the incredible sound design, Zimmer's score, ancient-futuristic production design, Fraser's cinematography and his clever use of B&W imagery to the entertaining screenplay, flawless editing, and the stunning visual effects, this motion picture might just be the culmination of Villeneuve's career. He has leveled up his game with Dune Part Two. Working on this scale requires mastery in filmmaking, which he has achieved flawlessly. Enjoyed every single frame of this movie. Cleverly embraced the looser adaptations of the book and aligned it to the plot.Dune Part Two is constantly challenged by conflicting political decisions, sociology, cultural influences, and religion. Yet the heart of it is a love story that carries the flow and weight of all.I stood up from my seat awe-struck, overwhelmed after the immersive consumption of a classic, top-tier space opera masterpiece, and got the chills down my spine during the ending credits.I'm thrilled to see how this trilogy ends when Dune: Messiah makes a comeback. Most recommended to watch it in the biggest screen you can get- preferably IMAX. For now, I'll have to rewatch and be anticipating for its Oscar sweep next year.",positive
926,"I Really liked the movie, and now you are probably asking why I have given it a 7/10. Visually 10/10 I think this should be the hollywood standard for every big blockbuster movie. I belevie everything I saw was ""for real"" escpecially the Scene where Paul rides the sand worm. That scene was beuatifully done.Now for the rest of the movie, The Dialog at times where really akward escpecially in some fight scenes where characters just stopped the fight to stare and say 1 single word or sometimes nothing at all, just akward silence. At first I didnt really notice it but when this pattern repeated it self, It got to me.Also I thought the Movie was overconfusing sometimes where the main character paul would be called like 5 different names in some prophercy. So it was hard to keep track at times who they were talking about.So to sum it all up, I wasnt too keen on the first dune film but thought it was a pleasnt surprice though it lacked a bit of action. This had a lot of action wich I liked but akward dialog and over complicated prophercys dragged this down a little. But over all a visually pleasing good movie. Would recommend it to anyone!",positive
927,"The story, the characters, the visuals, the twist, the mashup of sound and feelings was just mind bending, it gave me goosebumps actually! I'll be watching this movie for countless times and I'm sure I will come to love it more and more and more. Scifi seems to be on the rise again and Dune part 2 shows the start of an amazing coming year.In all honesty, I think for Dune to be beaten it will take a lot of even such is possible.I am extremely happy I was able to live this experience, to enjoy such an amazing movie on the big screen and I'd say it's a10/10 as it should be a 11/10!Just a wonderful experience! Thank you Dennis & all!Just saw it again and it's even better!",positive
928,"I am So disappointed. Maybe the hype got to me. I loved part 1.This is a good film, but I found it lacking. Something was missing. And it is difficult to put a finger on what that is.The editing was jarring and disruptive for some reason: Scenes did not flow into another. I felt as the viewer as though I was kept at a distance. But that was probably the point. The timing was off and the film kept jumping too quickly from scene to scene. I am a fan of the book. And had if it had not been for that; I may have given up on the film half way through.The costumes were good; but did not make such an impression on me as part 1 did.Overall: a good film; but it did not live up to expectations.",positive
929,"If u find 1 painful to watch, u can skip this part 2. Don't believe those movie reviews that part 2 pace is fast and exciting than 1. It's still boring and feel sleepy . Every 10 min have a scene Zendaya will look at Timothee to create a boring romance. Both actor totally no chemistry. Build up powerful villain at part 1,part 2 become a tools to build another Villain. Fight scene is stiff and not exciting. Bastita only know how to roar when failed his mission.So what u have a big universe story, Great cinematography,bgm, and cast. Actor totally no connection with each other,60 years ago story already fall behind today writing. This movie is a combination of GOT, Avatar and star war but fail miserably cannot compare with these 3.",positive
930,"One of the Greatest Films of this Decade so far
In many aspects of cinema this film exceeds.The cinematography, acting, music, production design, editing, directing and more are all worthy of an Academy Award Nomination if not a win.Seeing this in True 1.43 aspect ratio IMAX Laser at Boeing Pacific Science Center in Seattle was one the most breathtaking cinema experiences I have ever had.The cast is stellar, and Greg Frasier's cinematography is again magnificent. Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya did a very good job as Paul and Chani as did the other cast. It gets better when Paul really kicks it in in the 3rd act. Rebecca Ferguson did a very good job as Jessica and stands out.The comedic relief from Javier Bardem's Stilgar is enjoyable. I know there are mixed feelings about Christopher Walkens Emperor but he did a fine job but didn't do anything special, he was just there.Where this movie suffers is the dreadful pace. The first two thirds of the movie drag on, despite stuffing what was two years in the book to a couple months in the movie. This does lead to the ending feeling rushed.Dune: Part Two is an amazing cinematic achievement, and definitely one of the best films of the but I would not at all deem it as one of the greatest sequels of all time or compare it to The Dark Knight or The Empire Strikes Back.8.8/10 (coincidently this is the same as the IMDB rating)",positive
931,"This movie does so many things right. I don't even know where to start. Atmosphere, costumes, acting, lighting, music, tension build up and the list goes on. If you like the genre even a little bit it's an absolute must see.The story is interesting and original. It's a combination of intrige, philosophy, culture, sci-fi, and religion in a futuristic feudal setting and surprises you from time to time. I have not read the books so I don't know if the film follows the original story closely, but it worked perfect for me anyway.I loved every second of the movie but was completely blown away by the last hour.",positive
932,"I was absolutely blown away by this film. It's a cinematic masterpiece for It's time. It cannot be compared to the 1st one which was genius in It's own way. What I did right this time, is that I watched it in the Imax theatre (WOW).It has to be seen on the extra big screen with phenomenal sound, if not then also ok but it's the only way you can truly submersive yourself in the finer details of this film. The sound, the acting, the soundtrack, the landscape, the score, the story.It is a work of art! Denis Villeneuve, the true genius that he is, created a masterpiece! In every aspect. What a privilege to watch.",neutral
933,"Well... Part 2 DEFINITELY delivers on the promise of Part 1. Try to see them close together. This is really one film cut into 2 parts.There are some quite major deviations from the original Frank Herbert. I am at a loss to explain why the writers have done this - as they didn't need to.The impact of Dune 2 is as tremendous as the Novels. Acting is excellent, camera work excellent, music superb. The mesmerising quality of the desert planet Arrakis is brilliantly done. This thing is breathtaking, its scale is vast.Don't listen to anyone who says the Dune films are no good! They are fantastic!",positive
934,"This film will go down in history as one of the best sci fi films of all time. Every thread and aspect of this film is finely woven and well inspected and it works like a roaring, beastly, powerful machine. The music and visuals work in such stunning synchronicity, Hans Zimmer was really the only man for the job. Don't go into the film having already listened to the music to help the breathtaking experience. Villeneuve has given himself an impossible job: making Dune Messiah stand up to this film. I'm sure it's possible, Villeneuve has proved time and time again to be one of the most powerful filmmakers of his generation.",positive
935,"Cinematography is next level. The desert, the colors in every scene capture the mood so well. World building is good and we are introduced with new concepts bit by bit. Especially liked the intensity by Rutha.The action scenes are well scripted. The protagonist looks vulnerable and is not like a usual action hero/savior of the world. CHemistry is great between female and male lead. Some funny moments as well, Javier bardem looks great in appearance and acting.Even though the movie is long, one is looking forward to whats about to happen next. In the same league as part 1. Looking forward to next one.",positive
936,"There were great elements here, but they really needed someone in charge to tie it up into a nice hour and a half long package. It felt like way too much extra footage left in scattered all throughout the middle and mid-end, and I'm frustrated thinking about how much of a punch this movie could have packed if it were properly edited to do so. Still, great cinematography and sound design, and some intense moments in the first hour and last half hour or so. It would be hard to bring myself to go through a rewatch for these moments, given that I'd have to sit through all the rest, so this will probably wind up being a movie I forget about.",positive
937,"I watched all 2 hours and 46 minutes of this film in a state of rapture. Our theater was silent. No one moved, no one spoke. No one got up to use the restroom. It was as if we were all transported to Arrakis together, and we had no choice but to experience every moment of it.And it was glorious. To say this film is magnificent is an understatement. To say it's phenomenal does not fully explain its effect.Every shot is tuned precisely to what we need to see. Every sound and musical cue is perfectly matched with its visual component. The acting is flawless across the board. The cinematography is absolutely brilliant.Almost three hours of movie, and I wanted more. We all wanted more.In my opinion, there are only three genre-defining fantasy stories: Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Dune. After seeing Dune: Part One and this magnificent sequel, if I had to pick just one universe, I would choose the universe of Arrakis, of Caladan, of Paul and Chani, of Feyd and Baron, of Princess Irulan, every time.Long Live the Fighters.",neutral
938,"Better than the part one. The plot is way more clear and intriguing ,though not that complex or full of conspiracies . Pretty fancy the black and white bizarre circus arena .Incredibly integrating the tremendous symbol of power with a peculiar fright. To tell the truth,I have not read any of the dune novels, whereas Paul is seen as a good-shaped character from my view. He's merciful(perhaps not anymore) ruthless revengeful and curled into a crazy plotted thousand-year-long plan. Zendaya plays her part well. I could sense Chani has her
Different look on the war.The part two isn't perfect though .It just tells us a game of throne, a story of alien version Nazarene Messiah's revenge , without much ups and downs and is easy to see through. Also the switch point is too simple to make us fully understand the reasons behind Paul finally take his mind to be the Lisan al Gaib. And I doubt if the designed fate of the Houses can go on so smoothly as the prophecy says. That is somehow unreal to me .",positive
939,"This movie has received a tremendous amount of praise and hype. I was really looking forward to it because I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment. While Dune 2 is visually stunning, in my opinion the film is no masterpiece - certainly not on par with sequels like The Empire Strikes Back or The Two Towers. There were fun moments for sure, but to me, the overall story arc, the pacing, the character development - most of it fell flat. There was really no character I could care about or root for. The score by the great Hans Zimmer was forgettable. And the casting of Christopher Walken as the Emperor was a mistake. I came away disappointed.",positive
940,"Dune holds a special place in my heart as one of my all-time favorite books that has never received the same level of mainstream attention that the Star Wars universe has, which is some sort of cosmic irony considering how much Star Wars lore owes to the Dune novels and also to Jodorowsky's Dune. (Disclaimer: I am an unabashed Star Wars fanatic. Please don't take this as a slight towards my favorite fandom). Much like the Star Wars vs. Dune conundrum when it comes to popularity, Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors who holds a special place in my heart because he has made a lot of great movies that unfortunately haven't been box office sensations. Another modern director that he often gets compared to is Christopher Nolan who unlike Denis not only makes great movies, but has had a lot more financial box office hits. While I am extremely happy for Nolan especially since I rank him high on My Favorite Directors list, Denis Villeneuve continues to bring out the inner sci-fi nerd in me because he has arguably been the best sci-fi director of the 21st century. Sci-fi when done right, is my favorite genre of fiction whether it be books, video games, tv shows, or movies, Up until this point, Denis had made four straight films that were deemed hits by audiences and critics alike, but he never did reach mega box-office success. I couldn't be happier with the success that Dune Part 2 has had.The day was Saturday, March 2, 2024 and I was finally going to see my most anticipated movie since Dune [Dune: Part One]. As I sunk into the plush theater seat, I was swept up by a wave of nostalgia mixed with anticipation. The metallic voice of the Sardaukar pierced the silence, uttering those immortal words: ""Power over spice is power over all"". With that we were whisked back to Arrakis and got to experience for the next 2 hours and 46 minutes, one of the most influential stories of the sci-fi genre finally being told in a way that would be accessible to most audiences.From this point on there will be spoilers to both the book and the film below.Dune's accessibility to a broader audience marked a significant departure from some of the more intricate aspects of the original story. For instance, in Frank Herbert's novel, Alia, Paul's sister, is portrayed as a preternaturally gifted child who ages rapidly due to her exposure to the spice m‚àö¬©lange in the womb while also receiving the knowledge of all of the Reverend Mothers before receiving any agency herself. However, in Villeneuve's adaptation, Alia is reimagined as a fetus communicating telepathically with Lady Jessica, her mother. This alteration not only simplifies Alia's character arc but even more importantly, it saves Denis Villeneuve the trouble of having to find a toddler actress that not only is capable of quality acting, but also has parents who would be comfortable enough with letting their little girl crawl/walk around a movie set and then have the task of stabbing and killing Barron Harkonnen. Good luck casting department.Another way that Denis elected to make the film more accessible to modern audiences was with the portrayal of Fremen culture. While Herbert's novel meticulously details their strict customs and rituals, including the practice of water discipline and the importance of the sietch (Fremen underground dwellings), Villeneuve's adaptation opts for a more simplified approach that focuses more on showing us that the Fremen adapted to the desert without telling us how to everything. Which for a film, is almost always the correct approach. The film emphasizes themes of unity, cooperation, and resistance against oppression, showcasing the Fremen as a fiercely independent and resourceful people. But the biggest thing that the film changes about Fremen culture is that they portray the Fremen as a society where men and women are seen as equals. Whereas in the book, Paul goes through a ritualistic transfer of ownership after defeating Jamis in single combat acquiring his wife and children in the process. Purists will of course be upset with this alteration, but I think Denis made this change to make us empathize with the Fremen and highlight the contrast with outdated customs upheld by the Empire and the Bene Gesserit, such as the transfer of power through marriage, as seen with Princess Irulan. With the adaptation's alterations in mind, let's delve into the performances of the cast, who brought these reimagined characters to life on the screen.Timothy Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides was nothing short of remarkable. His every scream, every whispered command, felt like a visceral punch, thanks to the impeccable sound editing that transported us directly into the heart of Arrakis. It's almost as if Paul was wielding the Voice, compelling us to follow his every move. Paul emerges as a more relatable and empathetic figure, grappling with the weight of destiny and the burden of leadership. He finds himself torn between the survival of his people and the potential devastation of billions. The conflict between his personal desires and his duty to the Fremen, his family, and the entire universe is palpable in Chalamet's portrayal. This was the level of acting and writing I wish was present for Anakin Skywalker in the film Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Thankfully, Matthew Stover's novelization of the film does the story justice and I can't recommend it enough for any Star Wars fan out there. It truly blows that film away.But anyway, back to Dune. Chalamet skillfully navigates Paul's journey, portraying him as a man trapped by fate, forced to confront his own mortality and the inevitable consequences of his actions. What sets Chalamet's performance apart is his ability to convey Paul's internal struggle and conflicting emotions. He portrays a character who must reconcile his own desires with the greater good, knowing that his choices will shape the fate of worlds. Ultimately, Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides elevates the character to new heights, imbuing him with humanity and complexity and I am excited to see where his character goes in the upcoming Dune Messiah movie.Austin Butler's Feyd Rautha practically leapt off the screen with intensity and I loved every scene that he was in. His portrayal of the Baron's lovely Feyd seamlessly embodied the ferocity and cunning nature of House Harkonnen, delivering a performance that leaves a lasting impression. From his commanding presence in the electrifying introduction on Giedi Prime to his pivotal role in the intricate plots of the Bene Gesserit, Butler captures the essence of Feyd's character with intensity and depth and he just looked like he was having the time of his life playing the sociopathic villain. Though as great as Austin Butler was, what truly makes the character of Feyd so memorable is the meticulous setup crafted by Denis Villeneuve. In the books, on top of being a monstrous figure, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was heavily implied to be a pedophile that had a sexual preference for ""young men"" and was particularly attracted to his nephew Feyd. He explained to Feyd that all of his schemes and the chaos he unleashed was for Feyd to take over House Harkonnen and to ascend to the throne of the emperor. This intricate web of ""plans within plans"" adds depth to the Baron's character, positioning him as a master manipulator to set Feyd Rautha up as a rival for Paul. While the book delves deeper into the nuances of the Baron,'s character, the film amplifies Feyd Rautha's threat, portraying him as a significant player in the power dynamics of the Dune universe.Prior to the audience's introduction Feyd, we see Princess Irulan having a conversation with the Reverend Mother shedding light on the intricate power dynamics at play, revealing the Bene Gesserit's plan for the succession to the throne. Irulan learns that the only way for the Shaddam family to retain power is through marriage. She is presented with two potential suitors: Paul, whom the Bene Gesserit are determined to prevent from ascending, and Feyd Rautha, whom Irulan protests is a sociopath. However, the Bene Gesserit are undeterred by Feyd's character flaws. They are solely interested in determining if he can be controlled because they know that they cannot control Paul.Enter Giedi Prime: the planet with a Black Sun that absorbs all color. The scene on Giedi Prime is a masterclass in visual storytelling. Shot with infrared cameras to emphasize the stark brutality of the Harkonnen home world, it immerses viewers in a world of darkness and danger. Amidst this backdrop, Feyd Rautha's character shines, embracing the challenge of combat with a sociopathic zeal. His fight is not just a display of physical prowess but a testament to his formidable nature and unyielding determination. Feyd relished every moment of the brutal combat, showcasing a level of derangement that even for a Harkonnen was chillingly unique.After the battle was over, we encounter the steadfast Lady Fenring, a stark contrast to the defiant Lady Jessica. Where Jessica chose to defy the Bene Gesserit's plans by bearing a son, Paul, Lady Fenring embodies unwavering dedication to their schemes. Her relentless commitment to the Bene Gesserit cause stands in sharp contrast to Jessica's independent spirit and serves the purpose of letting the audience know of how deep the Bene Gesserit's manipulative influence goes.Meanwhile, the scene culminates in a crucial revelation: the realization that Feyd Rautha has the potential to be a candidate for the Kwisatz Haderach! This revelation was brought to light by his successful passage of the Gom Jabbar test. Additionally, Lady Fenring being impregnated by Feyd, and following the Revernd Mother's explicit instructions to ensure that the baby was a girl, ensures the continuation of the Harkonnen lineage as they, the Bene Gesserit, desire thus solidifying the Bene Gesserit's influence behind.",positive
941,"This movie completely exceeded my expectations. I was captivated by the story, the characters, the world that was built beautifully by Dennis Villeneuve.I don't want to give too much away, but what I will say is that the last time I experienced such entertainment in a cinema was from watching ""The Dark Knight "". This movie is at that exact same level. I am hooked, and cannot wait to see the next installment. Bring on Dune Part 3.The cinematography and soundtrack complimented each other like cheese & wine. It helped set the mood to an already incredibly impressive story. This movie was all I could ask for to a sequel to Dune Part 1. Dennis Villeneuve will have me anticipating all of his movies from here on out. Thanks for reading.",neutral
942,"Long time Dune fan. Read the books as a kid, watched the movies over the years.And this one cements Denis Villeneuve as the proper custodian for this tale this time around.The actors are amazing, even though i'm still a bit on the fence about Timothy.The score is perfect. It along with the visuals truly makes this movie so perfect.But what truly sold me, was when watching it in the theater, and the worm ride scene came on.I caught myself moving and squinting, like i was there in the scene.It was glorious. A must have experience that can only be delivered on the big screen.Sure the movie changes some things, but i don't mind as i feel that is to ensure a more fulfilling 3rd part.See it in the theater.",positive
943,"One of the best movies of the decade. Im talking empire strikes back level great. Fantastic writing, acting, worldbuilding, dialogue, action sequences, cinematography, production design and more. Its also thematically rich and features nuanced and multilayered, complex characters. Even in the first 5 minutes I knew it would be even better than the first (the first is still amazing btw.The score is flawless and the sound design is unique and exquisite. I really don't have any issues with this movie. I guess my only minor qualm would be that we barely got any screentime with florence pughs and Christopher Walkkens characters and it could've been pretty cool if we dived into their politics and storyline a tad more. Anyhow im sure we will see it more in Dune Messiah fingers crossed it happens.10/10 highly recommend. Probably will be my favourite movie of the year.",positive
944,"I'll start by saying that it's been a long time since a movie left me breathless like this. Such exquisite work, such delicacy and dedication could only result in a film that will leave its mark for a long, long time. As soon as the movie ends, it's hard to decide whether I want to watch it all over again or if I need a sequel. Dune 2 is a beautiful example that hard work and talent always pay off. I find it difficult to write about what I liked because I'm still ecstatic about what I saw. The character development works very well, especially with Paul and his mother's arc. The meticulously crafted art direction and photography, the sound design aimed at deeper immersion, the choreography of the fights is excellent, but what truly captivates us is the perfect work of director Denis Villeneuve who, unsurprisingly, hits the mark once again. A simply incredible film and worth every second.",positive
945,"Permit me to start off by saying this film was so beautifully introduced by the first one. I had anxiety when it was nearing completion because it would be over. Villeneuve once again tells a story using sound, vibrations, colour and technology in a flawless way. The performances by Chalamet, Zendaya, and Skaarsgard were impeccable. The performance that stood out for me was Butlers, I genuinely feared his character and he made me uncomfortable (of course, coupled with Villeneuves art). I would recommend anyone to watch this, it's a beautiful story that is told so well. You will be left wanting more.",neutral
946,"Massive disappointment. I know the book a little and I knew where the story was going, but the outcome is worse than I expected. I liked the first film, its grandiose settings, its open questions. The way the second responds is quite appalling.That the Emperor's throne comes down to a knife fight is already hard to swallow, but what's more, it ends with the good old trick of 'it's the hero who is dead, ah no it's the other one', already seen a million times in film, it's disappointing...Aesthetically, the story immensely reduces the ambitions of this second part by focusing on the Fremens and their rough desert settings. With the exception of a scene on the Harkonnen planet, Giedi Prime, which is rather impressive in martial white and black tones. That said, I still miss David Lynch's crazy and disgusting Harkonnen with their strange greenish/industrial planet and sexual perversions.Here we are in a demonstration of pure force, strangely contradicted by the ridiculous fear suddenly displayed by Rabban, and by an astonishing vulnerability of the Harkonnen troops like the Sardaukars to the guerrilla techniques of the Fremens without this being convincingly justified by the mise-en-scene.We can only imagine that what makes the difference is the infinitely superior number of the Fremen, greatly underestimated by the Harkonnen, which allows them to gain the upper hand at the cost of a major human sacrifice. But this quasi-genocidal aspect is only evoked by a film which obviously must be easy on the general public to be profitable. Here we touch on the structural limits of the project.",positive
947,"It's rare that I walk out of the theatre *more* excited about a film than I was going in. Especially when my anticipation was already so high. But Villeneuve and his crew absolutely pulled it off again with this mesmerising masterpiece that pulled me down to the surface of Arrakis and pushed me through a religious revolution without ever letting go.That's not to deny its flaws. It's probably a bit too long. Some characters are turned into a caricature of themselves. Some deviations from the book were clearly done for brevity, but others are serious deviations that will surely have major ramifications as the story continues. It hits a little too hard on the nose with its core message that religion is a great power but morally ambiguous.All of that is nit-picking however. The film manages to combine multiple plot lines, character development and world building without sacrificing pace or relying on fight scenes to keep the momentum going. It's true to the broad strokes (and some of the smaller ones) of Frank Herbert's vision, but perfectly accessible to someone who only saw part one years ago. Every piece of the film making craft comes together in this beautiful sci-fi epic. For once, the cliche that watching a film in a cinema (with the largest screen you can get to) is an 'experience' rings true.",positive
948,"The movie felt rushed. It felt disconnected to it's predecessor and missed to impress on a lot of areas. Sure it was visually stunning, other than there wasn't much I liked about it. Hopefully they can resurrect in the finale.Nearly 3 hours to build something magical and incredible like they did in the first film and they dropped the ball. The acting was inconsistent and disappointing. Not sure how you flop this bad when the first film was done so right.However that being said usually the second film of a trilogy is to build the story which they did in this film. I liked the original Dune better in this regard even though they didn't give us much. Let's see if they can close the series out properly.",negative
949,"Paul would not have lowered himself by saying ""you die like a pig"" to the Baron he now stabs in the throat like a barbarian. Miserable faithlessness to Herbert's vision and pandering to the tragic zeitgeist of retribution we are experiencing in society.This was a disappointment to watch the film and to forgive diversions here and there but this act fully changes the substance of what Paul is made of-no better than a Harkonnen.The imagery is colossal, imposing & threatening, this part is well-done. A shiny set distracts from the flaws of its actors and the storyline. I'm not saying the movie is a waste but don't expect it to be faithful to the novel. (For those of us left that read.)",neutral
950,"A cinematic masterpiece. Dune 2 is spectacular in every way. From the world building to the character development, everything was perfect, just as I had imagined it when I read the books. Every actor brought their A-game and, although I wasn't overly fond of Timothee as Paul in Dune 1, he did an amazing job this time. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha was even more menacing than in the books. Even for people who have not read the series, Denis explained as much as he could without taking away from the film, especially Bene Gesserit customs. Praise to Denis for his homage to the world of Frank Herbert. A monumental achievement. Long live the Fighters!!",positive
951,"The film ends in a different way compared to the book. Frank Herbert didn't want to portray Paul as a hero, but the anti-hero. And that's exactly what this film does with the altered end. Paul simply goes too far.There are bits which are rushed, but in general it has a nice pacing, the characters are believable, the actors are very good, and there's not a single moment in this film that made me feel bored or tired. It's an engaging experience from beginning to end.The way the story is laid out also doesn't patronise the viewer and doesn't dumb down the plot, which I like.There's no woke agenda here, no inclusivity pandering, no mischaracterised masculinity, no politics besides the one that's part of the Dune universe. It's a plain, good old-fashioned science fiction story with a healthy dose of drama.Best film I've seen this year, and one of the best I've seen in many years.",positive
952,"Are you excited for some thrilling sci-fi action? Well, get ready to be blown away as the highly anticipated 'Dune Part Two' has finally arrived and it's an absolute masterpiece! This movie is an absolute treat for any sci-fi enthusiast. Its stunning visuals are breathtaking and transport you to a completely different world altogether. The action sequences are so intense that they will keep you glued to your seat, and the story is so gripping that you will be left craving for more. The amount of detail that has gone into every aspect of the film is remarkable and speaks volumes about the hard work that has gone into its making. The cast delivers outstanding performances that are sure to leave a lasting impression on you. Overall, watching this movie is an experience that you wouldn't want to miss. So, don't miss out on the excitement and experience this incredible journey for yourself.",positive
953,"You sit in the theater and 2h 46m just rush by. The plot is dense, so many things happen in this movie that it almost feels bit to quickly narrated at times - albeit never ""rushed"". The reason why nothing feels rushed is due to the unparalleled visual spectacle that is Dune: Part Two. Large-scale battles, dense fight scenes, but also sweeping landscape shots and close-up moments between characters are all set into scene so stunningly, I truly think it's the best looking sci-fi movie of all time. And not only the cinematography is breathatking and epic, everything around it is, too: The costumes, the epic soundtrack and, espcially, the sound design. The whole sensory experience is so weighty and well-built.I also appreicate the daring choices of color grading which give the movie a welcome artistic element.For me, Dune: Part Two got stronger as it progressed. While some character arcs were told a bit quick, they did make sense in the end and lead to a more-than-epic climax and conclusion. I really hope a Part Three will be greenlit, I feel like I am anything but tired of watching the world of Dune unfold out of Denis Villeneuve's hands.",positive
954,"The plot, the cast, the visuals, the sounds, music... everything was, in a word, EPIC!After watching the first movie, I wasn't expecting a lot from the second one, but I'm glad I was proven wrong. You can tell the budget was high and they really spent every last cent on making this the highest quality possible. It really makes you dive into that world and experience it as if it's a real thing. The acting was very convincing (especially the chemistry between Timoth√©e and Zendaya) and paired with amazing sound effects (in certain scenes) really satisfying.If you plan on watching this movie, make sure to watch it in a cinema for the best experience (it will be worth it!).",positive
955,"It'd not often I'll sit a write up a movie review, but after just experiencing this masterpiece in I-Max I felt like I just had to.This part 2 could not have been done better. The score, fights, worms, heroism and just sheer intensity had me gripped from start to finish. On every level, it's a set of cinematic genius. The craft is expertly made, and it shows in every shot, every note of the score, and every scene that transports the audience to Arrakis.Really loved the character development between Paul and Chani as well.A great addition is Austin Butler as the baron's sociopathic, hyper-vicious nephew. He did look in awe of the Muad'Dib powers - As it was written!!",positive
956,"I absolutely love part 1. Every scene was a tableau; understanding such a complex story was made easy with the help of a well timed and thought out editing. I was thrilled to see how different (and good) this part was from the first movie.Part 2 on the other hand, is weirdly edited (veeeerry long at first and the hero moves at the speed of light sometimes..) and the esthetically perfect tableaus are no more. Scenes are as standard as can be; such as they are in any Hollywood movie. As a result, the tale I was so thrilled about becomes a regular good story.Such a shame. I liked it.But man, it could have been epic.",positive
957,"My heart is still feeling the beauty and pain after watching this transcendent film four days ago.The tension between tragedy and beauty, pain and love... My heart is completely stolen by this world and the stories that it tells.This movie has reached a territory that I couldn't imagine possible for film. I can't find much fault but rather shocked at finding the opposite.There has never been another world cultivated cultivated to this degree.There has never been a story told like this before.This will surely remain in the heats and minds of all who witness.This will go down as one of earths best.",positive
958,"Just watched the movie.The visuals and music were top notch. Story was good(i haven't read the book , so can't compare)Tbh some time jumps felt out of place.The ending was good but i think we could have gotten more battle elements and I felt it short.Overall I would rate it 7.5 /10It's worth watching in the big screen especially the visuals are so amazing it felt like there were actually planets like ArrakisCast:Timothy gave one hell of a performance
Zendaya have a good performance too
Rebecca instilled fear with her acting
Austin butler was good but could have hd more scenes
Javier acted ""as it was written""Rest of the cast acted well too.",positive
959,"The first three quarters of the movie were a close enough interpretation of the source material to be acceptable and entertaining. The forced love story between Paul and Chani, however, veered too far away from the book in an attempt to create a tragic romance for the sake of a Hollywood ending, and ultimately ruined the movie.Spoilers. For those who haven't read the book, the romance between Paul and Chani (sounding like 'Johnny' when Timoth√©e Chalamet says it), is not a source of tension. The falsely created subplot, in which Chani declares Paul a false prophet, and the overall sour-faced, disgruntled demeanor that Zendaya portrays during the last quarter of the movie, are fabrications by Denis Villeneuve. The bigger question is, does this enhance or take away from the overall story? Absolutely, without a doubt, this detracts from the story because it shifts focus from the central nemesis of the film while simultaneously failing in an attempt to create a love story that the audience cares about.To cap it off, the final close-up on Chani emitting a pouty, quivering chin is a failed attempt to evoke heartbreak we should care about.Denis was trying way too hard to create the Trinity/Neo romance and somehow force it into his version of Dune, which up until this point did a superb job of sticking to the pages of the book. Dune part one: excellent. Dune part two: ruined by a flat, forced, zero-chemistry, poorly executed, made-for-the-movie heartbreak story. Or perhaps it's simply a poor performance by Zendaya, who came across as far too unlikable. I've talked to others who didn't read the book and felt the same way. Either way, it's a miss.",positive
960,"The story in ""Dune: Part Two"" picks up right where the first film left off. Though the two projects were filmed separately, there is a singular vision and story arc between them. Writer/Director, Denis Villeneuve, is becoming a true powerhouse in Sci-Fi cinema, with ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"" in his filmography. This movie is no different, as it is truly a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films that I have ever seen. There were multiple scenes that left me in awe, from the ambitious world-building and use of color. Similarly, the score by Hans Zimmer is compelling and mighty. The man composed the score for ""The Lion King"", ""Interstellar"" and ""Gladiator"", and this might be his best work. Pairing the visuals with the score makes this film feel larger than life, which makes Villeneuve's attention to characters so significant.The character of Paul Atreides should be studied for years to come. His growth and development over these two films is beautifully executed, and the other characters are no different. As his eyes change color and he embraces his destiny, there is a confident maturity that transcends the screen. Timothee Chalamet puts forth the best performance of his career and many others, including Rebecca Ferguson (""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"") and Zendaya follow suit.This isn't much of a negative, but the first film is a must-watch if you are going to enjoy and understand ""Dune: Part II"". The story is full of complicated titles, planets, and prophecies. From the Bene Gesserit and the Lisan al Gaib to the Harkonnens, there is a lot to digest. Watching the first film with subtitles is almost a prerequisite.Masterpiece. That is the best word to describe the powerful achievement of ""Dune: Part Two"". In every way, this movie builds on the first installment and feels larger than life. In my opinion, it is the best film released in the last five years (maybe even ten) and one of the most epic films I have seen on the big screen. If you have the chance, go to the theater to see it, you will not be disappointed.Best Character: Muad'Dib
Best Quote: ""Lead them to paradise"" - Paul
Best Scene: Riding the worm.Best Piece of Score: ""Kiss the Ring""Note: I usually don't enjoy Javier Bardem's work, but he did great in this.Written for the Gunnison Gazette.",positive
961,"Dune Part 2 is truly amazing in terms of story, music, visuals and characters. The film is almost 3 hours long but it doesn't feel like it because the storyline is not boring and each character is also not wasted. A masterpiece in the midst of superhero films that are starting to get bored and have no clear direction. As a sequel dune 2 starts the story without missing a beat. Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), continue their adventure on the desert planet Arrakis.Out of the clutches of the Harkonnen, they try to join the Fremen, including Chani (Zendaya), who appeared several times in Paul's dreams in the first film. As Paul tries to understand their customs, Lady Jessica tells the Fremen that her son is the leader they have been waiting for according to the prophecy.Denis Villeneuve succeeded in presenting perfect details. The worlds he creates are stunning, from the desert of Arrakis to majestic palaces. The appearance of giant sandworms and neatly choreographed battle scenes are entertainment for those who enjoy the sci-fi action genre. Villeneuve succeeded in transforming the visuals from Frank Herbert's novel beautifully in every scene.Dune 2 also presents deep and interesting characters. Timothee Chalamet takes Paul Atreides to new heights with a compelling performance, just the right amount of charismatic and intimidating, conveying the complexity of Paul's character ideally. Zendaya, who previously only appeared a few times in Dune: Part One, now has the opportunity to explore Chani's character as a strong and brave figure.The presence of supporting roles such as Lady Jessica and Princess Irula (Florence Pugh) also adds to the complexity of the political complexities in the world created by Villeneuve. Javier Bardem as Stilgar also gave an extraordinary performance that will stick in the audience's memory. Likewise, Austin Butler, who previously impressed through Elvis (2022), again displays his eccentric and memorable role.",positive
962,"Dune: Part 2 is the best sci-fi film of all time, and it's not even close! The music, the cinematography, the dialogue, the action... what could you possibly compare it to? Has to be up there with the best in terms of sequels as well, as it outmatches the Dune: Part One in every single way possible. I will be thinking about this film forever and I can't wait to see it again. I am usually let down when a movie has this much hype, but this one truly lives up to it and then some. I will say that Walken as the emperor could have been done better and perhaps played by someone else, but that does not take away from the brilliance of this film. Go see it now, in IMAX if you can, it is truly breathtaking. BRAVO!",positive
963,"Being as someone who has never read the books, I found both movies very interesting and intriguing. The concept of another story about a tragic hero may seem boring and overused to some but this story, at least this movie saga, does it right. The first movie is perfect in setting up the events that take place in the second one. The filmography is spectacular, the sound design might be the best this year, and the acting is phenomenal too. The movie is 3 hours long but from the very start of the movie, you are on the edge of your seat. The scene in the coliseum-like venue might be my favorite sequence this year. And (spoiler) the end fight between Paul and the Harkonen fighter is great. I went into this movie with good expectations and left feeling more than satisfied and wanting more at the same time. All I hope is that there will at least be a Dune 3 after this.",positive
964,"Visually stuning, a true masterpiece.Anyone rating this movie anything under 10 needs to be admitted.The movie was almost 3 hours long but I didn't want it to end. Absolutly brillant. The acting the storyline.I remember Dune 1984 being one of my favorite movie as a kid and then discovering the books after and then the video games. This movie honors them all and it's so rare for a movie to honor the books it was based of.The soundtrack, like the part 1, is a masterpiece.I never wrote a review on here before, but my goodness I left the theater feeling like my life was empty now. I need to see it again.I sure hope they will release an extended cut.",positive
965,"Describing a movie as flawless might seem foolish, yet for ""Dune: Part Two,"" such a claim is apt. Simply put, this film embodies flawlessness.Dune embodies the essence of every sci-fi epic, and beyond. It sets the standard every movie should aspire to reach, for I, in awe, endured 166 minutes, as did the entire theater, captivated by its sheer brilliance.Denis Villeneuve is truly passionate about his work, and it shines through on screen. He ensures that every detail, from cinematography to choreography, is crafted with an extraordinary level of care and attention.Throughout its riveting 166-minute runtime, I was never once distracted. It only grew more captivating with each passing moment, and oh, that second half - it was, quite simply, the most astonishing thing I've witnessed in years.Every member of the cast delivered stellar performance's, contributing to the film's excellence. Special commendation goes to Austin Butler, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem for their outstanding contributions, which, in my view, elevated the movie to new heights of cinematic achievement.""Dune"" boasts awe-inspiring makeup, costumes, art direction, and performances that dare to redefine cinematic excellence. As we eagerly anticipate ""Dune: Part Two,"" it's clear this saga will boldly etch its legacy as a fearless masterpiece, thanks in no small part to the daring vision of Greig Fraser.While it's still in theaters, catch it on IMAX. Trust me, it's an experience you won't soon forget - the cinematic event of the decade.10/10.",positive
966,"I do not want to 'overhype' the movie. I loved part one so much. However, I think that part two is even better than part one. The cinematography is obviously as incredible or better than part one, but somehow even the character development, the plot, and the action are all incredible too. This movie is more intense and the stakes feel much higher.The soundtrack perfectly complements the visuals, leaving you entranced and in awe throughout the movie. The incredible imagery shines through. The rise to power throughout the movie gives off a sense of power and an exuberant sense of overwhelming strength.Overall, I suggest watching this movie. If you haven't seen part one, I would watch part one first.",positive
967,"Nearly three years after the first part we finally get a contination of the Dune story. Can't say some parts of the movie made my jaw drop to the ground, though some sequences were kind of... meh. Don't get me wrong. The movie's good. It has marvelous special effects and computer graphics, action packed scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with those realistic looking explosions and people falling left and right, but what it also has some significant downsides that diluted my otherwise good perception of this movie.But let's start with the good things first.The cast is exceptional. From the main characters to the extras. I liked the fact that they made all factions in this movie look and feel distinct with different languages, names, costumes and coor schemes. With cast of well-known actors such as Christopher Walken, Zendaya, Dave Bautista I especially want to commend the acting of Timoth√©e Chalamet, the scene where Paul Atreides proclaimed himself as the Prophet and the Leader of the Fremens really gave me goosebumps.The sound design in this movie is superb. Whether it's the sound of hot blazing desert, sand blasting the face of the main character when he mounts a desert worm, explosions, gunshots, swords clashing, make your adrenaline levels go through the roof, making you feel like it's you who's fighting there.Special effects and computer graphics are simply gorgeous. From alien skylines with celestial objects visible in the sky to nuclear warheads exploding. All done too well, this movie is simply beautiful.Now let's get to the problems this movie has.The main problem for me is that all fights in this movie, except the
last one is one-sided. Entire movie is Harkonnen dummies getting slaughtered left and right by some desert dwellers that don't even have ranged weapons? Even though Harkonnen possess aviation, machine guns, long range sniper rifles, rockets and they just get slaughtered in the open in melee fights without even giving much resistance? And we supposed to think that they are some kind of warrior caste? A huge let down in that department. Problem with this is that they don't seem too much of a formidable enemy and because of that stakes are low. From the start of the movie when Fremens just completly utterly destroy squad of Harkonnens without any losses we just know that Paul Atreides and Fremens aren't in any trouble fighting these guys, which makes battles not that interesting. The Batista's character death was very underwhelming and a huge letdown. The fight itself was less than 10 seconds and as I just mentioned before, very one-sided. The one and only decent fight was between Paul and Feyd-Rautha, the stakes very high and it was a very beautifully choreographed fight.The second problem is that Paul Atreides abilities feel undeserved. He barely escaped with his life in the first movie, and in the second he just starts dropping harkonnens left and right, and in the finale even gains some kind of godlike ability that lets him see past, future and read minds. Kind of Mary Sue character.As a conclusion I would like to say that it was a solid movie and I enjoyed it wholeheartedly and if you wonder what to watch on the week end, I would gladly recommend you this flick.",positive
968,"I recently watched Dune 2, and I must say, I wasn't very impressed. Unless you're an avid Dune fan or have read the book, it's quite difficult to follow. A significant issue is the lack of a recap of the first film at the start, which leaves viewers who haven't recently watched Dune 1 at a disadvantage.Many book adaptations stray too far from the novel, but Dune 2 appears to have the opposite problem. It seems to follow the novel so closely at times that it fails as a movie. The film feels episodic and lacks a coherent rhythm or pace. Hardcore sci-fi enthusiasts might love it, but for the average ""generalist"" movie watcher, it's a hard slog.From a narrative perspective, the film is overly dark and lacks the lighter moments that bring contrast to a story. This results in a plot that feels flat and one-dimensional. Overall, Dune 2 might satisfy die-hard fans of the series, but it falls short for those seeking a more balanced and engaging cinematic experience.",positive
969,"I LOVED this movie. I only recently watched Dune part 1 a few months ago and was so taken away by it, (and so regretful for not watching it in theatres to get the full experience) I had high expectations and it exceeded. The pacing in the 2nd half did feel a little rushed compared to the first half but this was such a beautiful movie all around. This has been the ONLY movie that I am (and will) pay a full price ticket for to watch again and again in theatres. Down to the acting, visuals, writing, score, special effects, sound effects, etc.It hits all the marks for me.Special shout out to Javier Bardem for making me crack up with his character!! (LISAN AL GAIB!!)
All of the cast was phenomenal!I am sure this movie will win TONS of well deserved awards.10/10.",positive
970,"Its always difficult to bring a sci fi Novel to the big screen and after a successful first film, the second blew it out water. Story, cast, cinematography, soundtrack, moments of humour, the emotions the film takes you through... breathtaking. Probably a modern day classic which will be talked about for decades to come. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it didn't feel as long as it stated I could have continued watching. This was a dramatic pulsating story of good vs evil a story we we are witnessing today the very definition of David and Goliath. Incredible film wow blown away from the visuals.",positive
971,"That was fantastic! Hans Zimmer's score was incredible, and each scene took me on a journey through different parts of my brain. It sparked so many memories! Thanks for this amazing cinematic experience.I also loved the movie's exploration of undiscovered potential within the human mind. It seems like they were hinting at that throughout the film. I'm even more intrigued to see where the story leads.While I might have gotten a bit confused and thought this was part one, I can't wait to watch the entire trilogy in one sitting someday! I'm new to this universe but as I said to my friend that's Star Wars for adults.",positive
972,"Spellar and Spectacular! The film grabs you from start to finish. Chalamet is at the top of his game, giving his most impressive performance. He is the perfect Paul Atreides. Villeneuve really nailed it. The culmination it produces with part 1 is Science at his peak. I was on board with every changes and every departure of the book. It's the perfect adaptation and cinema at its purest. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Florence Pugh, Charlotte Rampling and Javier Bardem are an incredible supporting ensemble and shines bright. It's up there with The Two Tower from Jackson, The Empire Strikes back from George Lucas that it somehow exceeds even. Hans Zimmer will receive the Oscar, no doubt. This will make a Razzia at the next Academy Award in 2025, for sure.",neutral
973,This is a mystical movie nt Star Wars. The Messiah is in most civilisations. Very well acted and locations are excellent. The backdrop to the movie is water. Water in our World is becoming more precious and precarious. Not in Northern Ireland but further south along the Mediterranean and around the World. Timothee is excellent in the main role. Obviously there is going to be sequel. Really enjoy the film but remember Francesca Annis in the original. Francesca was more human as the Mother figure. But all the actors in this sequel were excellent. Will definitely go to see the Dune 3.Very well directed by Villennue.Highly recommend to anybody. Go see.,positive
974,"Wow! Dune: Part Two blew us away! It's easily one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. Everything about it was amazing!The story flowed seamlessly from Part One, and even though it's nearly three hours long, it didn't feel like it. The pacing was perfect, and we were hooked from start to finish.The special effects were incredibly realistic, and the actors portrayed their characters brilliantly. The chemistry between them felt genuine, and nothing seemed fake or forced.Director Denis Villeneuve did an outstanding job, and the action scenes were mind-blowing. The sound in IMAX was incredible, making the experience even more immersive.Hans Zimmer's score was masterful, and it added so much to the film. Overall, Dune: Part Two is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise it's getting.If you're a fan of sci-fi, don't miss this movie. It's truly something special and will leave you in awe.",positive
975,"Dune went pretty much down-hill in the second part. The whole story feels fully constructed and is full of flaws and plot holes. Like in the beginning they raid a harvester which has support legs, even though it runs on tracks... they put a lot of effort into hiding behind those legs and then shot down a fighter, after that they destroy the harvester with powerful lasers. Before and after that scene all harvester do not have these legs. Also on the following raid, they can kill the harvester with lasers even while multiple fighters fly around. Why did they not shoot down the fighters with the lasers first? Why those lasers never been used before by anybody, not even in the fight sword vs sword, nobody is using lasers except the desert people? Then the means of transport is riding a worm? Why does the worm stay on the surface, why it doesn't dive. They said if worms meet they fight to the death, yet they can ride 4-5 worms parallel and they seem to get along. Then at one scene he drinks the water of life and suddenly everybody else is there. Wasn't he just in the north and said he can't go south, whereas everybody else went south? How was he there first and how did everybody else show up after he drank? Why did he not drink after his mother had a sip? Why the old mother said they made a mistake when she realized the pregnancy? After watching the movie, it just felt like the story was written so it's reaching the desired end no matter the means... to me this all made no sense in the end. Lots of points for cast and fx.",neutral
976,"""Dune: Part Two"" invites audiences into a mesmerizing narrative universe, mixing the stories of love, revenge, and fate of the main protagonist, Paul Atreides. The film emerged not just as a sequel but as an immersive cinematic experience, marrying the incredible visual and deep narrative. The opening scenes alone show the grandeur element of the movie where the vastness of the desert is captured in wide shots and breathtaking cinematography.The combination of the talented Denis Villeneuve as the director and Greig Fraser as the cinematographer becomes apparent and results in a visual masterpiece. The imagery is not just a backdrop but a character in its own right, shaping the emotional landscape of the film. One standout scene unfolds when Paul Atreides, played by the exceptional Timotthe Chalamet, confronts the ruins of his ancestral home. That scene alone serves as a poignant visual metaphor for the shattered remains of the legacy that his family built for decades. Chalamet has proven himself to be an actor with depth and serious talent that transcends across the big screen. Chalamet masterfully navigates his character's journey from vulnerability to a determination to reclaim what was lost, setting the tone for the overarching themes of resilience and revenge.The narration of religion becomes palpable in a pivotal scene where Paul grapples with prophetic visions. The sequence masterfully blends visual effects with Hans Zimmer's haunting and captivating score which creates an atmosphere that is fueled with mysticism. The film effectively balances organized religion with an exploration of mystical elements embedded in Frank Herbert's material. One of the film's most visually arresting moments occurs during a Fremen sandworm hunt. The usage of CGI effects is a testament to the film's commitment to pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. As the movie progresses and the characters navigate through the desert terrain, each frame not only showcases the film's technical achievement but also propels the narrative forward, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between spectacle and powerful storytelling.One of the highlights of the movie is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica which contributes a layer of complexity to the story. In one particular scene where she imparts wisdom to Paul, Ferguson infuses the character with such maternal gravity that adds layers and depth to their relationship. Her nuanced performance coupled with the rich character development, anchor the film in emotional authenticity. Javier Bardem and Dave Bautista also deliver a memorable performance as Stilgar and Rabban, respectively. In a scene where Stilgar confronts Paul about his intentions with the Fremen, Bardem's commanding presence underscores the tension between the native inhabitants and the newcomers. Bautista's Rabban, a brutal enforcer, exudes menace, creating a palpable sense of threat that permeates the narrative.Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, and Charlotte Rampling, contributed to the film's complex story. With their performances that are convincing and commanding, some scenes featuring their characters added layers to the story which resulted in a web of relationships that enriches the narrative.The richness of the movie's theme extends to a sequence that explores the balance of romance and broader narrative. As Paul and Chani, played wonderfully by Zendaya, unfold and navigate through their relationship, explore the film's complexities of love amidst a backdrop of political intrigue and impending war. The romance, initially presented as the focal, seamlessly marries with the overarching themes of religion and fate.The culmination of these narrative threads is evident in climactic battle scenes that pit Fremen against formidable adversaries. The scene choreography of the action sequences, accompanied by the film's impeccable visuals, results in a visceral and intense cinematic experience. The stakes are high, and the film successfully maintains tension without sacrificing its commitment to visual grandeur. The combination of visuals and storytelling is perhaps the most evident in a scene where Paul faces a moral dilemma. The interplay of light and shadow, coupled with Zimmer's evocative score, added the emotional weight of the moment. The film's ability to balance spectacle with substance underscores its place not only as a visual feast but also as a powerhouse in storytelling.As the film progresses, the story embraces the philosophical underpinnings of Herbert's source material. In a scene where Paul contemplates his role as a potential messiah, the film delves into questions of destiny, free will, and the consequences of wielding immense power. This exploration adds intellectual depth to the narrative, inviting audiences to ponder the implications of Paul's journey. The film's final act also delivers a direct resolution that is both satisfying and open-ended. As Paul fights with the consequences of his choices, the movie leaves room for contemplation. In a scene where Paul confronts the complexities of leadership, Timothee Chalamet's performance captures the weight of his character's innate responsibility.In conclusion, ""Dune: Part Two"" transcends the confines of traditional sequels, standing as a testament to the potential of cinema as an art form. The marriage of breathtaking visuals, masterful storytelling, and nuanced performances creates a cinematic experience that resonates on multiple levels. The film's exploration of love, revenge, religion, and destiny unfolds within a visual landscape that is as captivating as it is thought-provoking. Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus, ""Dune: Part Two"" sets a new standard for cinematic excellence, leaving an enduring legacy in the annals of film history.",positive
977,"Too many grand entries, too much emphasis on minute movements in the heat of a fight and drifting frames for calm scenes make it boring towards the end. It is hard to stay put and concentrate on he story. A lot of little things were included which made the bigger things less important. The translation of the book was too close literary and thus was confusing, the essence lost. It felt like a dogged translation. A little distance from the book would have helped.Also a unique story would have been nice if nothing else was working. With such amazing actors what couldn't you have done. And with that budget you could throw the audience in an awe.",positive
978,"All Dune movies so far have resulted in them being turned off before I could finish them. Dune 2 had the better chance at getting a better review untill zendaya came along. (So didnt take long ) She is a terrible actress and ruined the whole movie. She was never even that great on Disney so I'm not to sure why people keep hiring her? For the reaction I guess?For a movie that failed so bad the first time, You would think they would have known a heck of a lot better this time. Still terrible, still boring and still with terrible actors. I generally hope you don't make a third. Or if you do.... it should be completely different!",positive
979,"NOTE: I am more or less combining the two movies in one review since it really is one movie in two installments, similar to the Lord of the Rings movies by Peter Jackson.The short of it is, these two movies will go down in history as two of the greatest SF/Fantasy movies of all time. These films capture the feel of the novel as not just SF about highly-advanced technology but also about sophisticated societies and mysticism which puts it into the realm of science fantasy as it is sometimes called, similar to ""Star Wars"". Simultaneously, the movie has a superb balance between awe-inspiring wars and the emotions of the main characters. The best description might be the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov meets Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.When ""Dune"" written by Frank Herbert was published in 1965 by Chilton, a publisher mainly of auto repair book manuals no less, nothing like it had ever appeared in SF before. It wasn't only the scope, the action taking place among several politically and culturally sophisticated societies on a planet called Arrakis aka Dune. Some of the novels by Robert Heinlein did have some similar elements. But Herbert brought a new depth which had yet to be explored in SF.Herbert combined several elements which had rarely (if ever) been assembled in a single SF novel before.First, a galactic political structure inspired by the Italian city-states of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. The galaxy is run by an Emperor and twelve noble houses, and the rivalry between the Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen form the core of the events. Paul Atreides, the central character, is the son of Duke Atreides and heir to its rule. Harkonnen is ruled by Baron Harkonnen who gives a new definition to the word ""overweight"". Harkonnen may have been inspired by the Medicis of Florence, and maybe House Atreides loosely inspired by the House of Mocenigo in Venice. Or he simply made each House their own character. Of course the baddies are House Harkonnen, bald albinos, where there is very little individuality, almost like clones.Second, a trade commodity with high demand. Indigenous to Arrakis is the spice Melange, which is only found on Arrakis which makes Dune a prize possession in the galaxy. Melange has both healing and even regenerative capabilities as well euphoric effects making it the most highly-sought-after commodity in the Galaxy.Third, sophisticated societies. On Arrakis there are several cultural societies, some friendly, others more adversarial. There are the Fremen who are native to Dune and divided up into several different groups, one of which believes in the prophecy of a savior while another looks at the world from a more secular view. (Sound familiar?)There is also the Bene Gesserit, an interplanetary matriarchal society with mystique powers. They have elements of a Roman Catholic Convent with those of the Knights Templar. They are mostly nonviolent but use their mystique powers to wield power over the other Houses. Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and Paul's mother.And then a random impediment. What makes mining the spice Melange so challenging is that giant sandworms roam all over Dune. They are about as long as a two tower bridge with a height and width of about six trains. They are attracted by static repeating sounds which makes avoiding them very difficult.All these elements combined into a messianic and militaristic adventure at the highest level. Incredible movie adapted from an incredible book.",positive
980,"Better than the first even, for me. It's neat that with Paul's omnipresence, you could think of this as just another permutation in the multiverse that has played out. And the updates are very welcome. The Baron from the previous film. More autonomy for the women, reflecting more overtly the culture, and some much larger implications around the children of dune too. The baby is not yet born, but in the books by the time the showdown happens, it's been quite a few years. Also, Chani is very different. I like that I don't know what will happen next, despite reading the two trilogies.One thing that does bug me, though, is not including the water ceremony for Jamis, killed in the previous movie, so not a spoiler. The absolute best part of the book is Paul having to carry Jami's water afterward, and the ceremony where people remember him, in which Paul says: I was a friend of Jamis. He taught me that when you kill, you pay for it. And when he cries, people say He Gives Water To the Dead.For a more... moral Paul being portrayed in the movie, it's wild they didn't include it. It's a powerful moment.",positive
981,"Dune: Part 2 is worth a watch. Multiple watches even. On the biggest screen with the best sound available. It is pure IMAX wonder. The cinematography is gorgeous, the music and sound eerie and unsettling at all the appropriate moments, the direction is wonderful, and the characterization brilliant, the plot follows the spirit of the books. If you are a fan of the books, there are certain critiques to be had, which are valid from a fan who knows what they're talking about. However, if you are to introduce a newbie to Dune...Part 1 and Part 2 here are a great way to do so. I can't imagine how many people will read the Dune series because of this film. Watching Paul's character arc is worthwhile and satisfying and the main thread of the film. The supporting cast/characters arguably steal the show, which says a lot about them because Chalamet did wonderfully. And yes, all the disappointed Zendaya fans from Part 1 for her lack of screen time, you get to see more of Zendaya in this one. There are twists and turns in the story that will keep you guessing and even leave you feeling deeply unsettled because, well, that's Dune's story. The fight scenes have intense tension, characterization, storytelling, and drama. This movie is a classic in the making, and a sight to behold! Bravo.",positive
982,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 has personally done for me what Revenge of the Sith done for many parents watching it when it first released. The development of the story of Paul Atreides is shaping itself to be a tragic one, reflective of the story in the book. Paul Muad'dib is sadly taking his own Anakin-like route down this fictional universe.What Dune established is further cemented and cemented very well by Dune 2, Denis Villeneuve has delivered a groundbreaking addition into the Science-fiction genre and it is one that in comparison to its sluggish predecessor, is one to remember. There are emotions here and such a connection to this universe that is crafted that cannot be said to not be genuinely making you want to see more.As we follow the story of the Fremen and Paul Atreides' (Timothee Chalamet) fulfilment of his true legacy, we start to wrestle with the dangerous idea of faith and despair - for the struggles of the Fremen can only be ended by the arrival of the Lisan Al Gaib - this being a sacrificial path to take. The world building Denis Villeneuve puts into play is to me
like none other that we've seen for a long time, of course Dune 1 is equally as amazing yet what Dune 2 manages to add on is just unbelievable.Regarding the casting, there are some soon-to-come Oscar's whose rightful owners should belong to the cast of Dune 2. Timothee Chalamet for one has undoubtedly proven himself in recent years as one of this generations acting powerhouse - from his flamboyant portrayal of Willy Wonka to his role as the deeply confused teenager Elio in Call Me By Your Name. His portrayal of Paul Atreides in this installment of the Dune universe is gripping and impactful, we are seeing a ""troubled villain"" in the making and his portrayal of the religiously haunted saint of the Fremen is incredible, as he balances saving those he cares about with discovering who he truly is. As for Chani (played by the talented Zendaya) there is not much to say due to sheer awe. Zendaya is an emotional lead and a powerhouse at the front of the Fremen, she embodies the struggles of the people of the dunes battling the corruption of religious fanaticism. I was also very charmed and taken off guard by the sheer excellence of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha, the new governor of Arrakis. To say he may be the best villain since Heath Ledger's much respected Joker would not be undeserving praise. However, Feyd-Rautha sadly suffers from the issue that comes with killing a villain off too quickly, being that his true potential is not fully witnessed. It was also very nice to see the lovely Javier Bardem play both a religiously devoted fanatic and Timothee Chalamet's biggest hypeman, though I do wish Dennis Villeneuve had explored more the gripping conflict plaguing his mind - due to Stilgar being a plagued man in the books, struggling with his devotion to this prophecy. As for the rest of the supporting cast - whose roles though at times did not take the spotlight as much - don't leave much to be said except for sheer appreciation for such a passionate portrayal. Rebecca Ferguson stepping into the reverend mother identity of Lady Jessica and giving up a lot of the things she cared for is such a sad portrayal of a mothers sometimes sacrificial role. Equally, Josh Brolin (Avengers Endgame, No Country For Old Men) and his portrayal of Gurney is better than ever with his character truly being such a good shoulder to lean on for our young Atreides. The whole cast is deserving of so many applauds for their chemistry and ability to connect to bring this universe alive, never felt more connected to a cast and their characters who I have now
come to love.The world of Arrakis and its other less explored planets also never feels more alive and that's not because they are genuine real
places but rather because Greig Fraser's cinematography has managed to make the dunes of Arrakis as real as possible. The visuals - to say they are captivating - is an understatement, this is a world that feels alive filled with grief and hopelessness in the very sands and through its very people, the Fremen. Greig Fraser builds such a beautiful Arrakis - utilising the Panavision H-Series lenses and the re-housed Soviet Helios 40-2 Lens from The Batman - that it is simply
mesmerising. Also absolutely loved the experimentation with Feyd-Rautha's black and white intro scene, I always love when black and white is incorporated into modern cinema, it gives films such a charm.As for the soundtrack that is largely on repeat as this is being written, from 'Cornfield Chase' to 'A Time of Quiet Between the Worms', Hans Zimmer once again develops his case for this generations and the past's greatest composer. The World of Arrakis, the emergence of the Shai-Hulud and the evil of the Harkonnens's cannot be bought to life without this soundtrack. 'A Time of Quiet Between the Worms' and its explosive counterpart, 'Beginnings Are Such Delicate Times' are genuinely two soundtracks that have made me so reminiscent of Gladiator's 'Now We Are Free', another genius score from Hans Zimmer.Denis Villeneuve's Dune 2 is deserving of a cinematic legacy, to be remembered as one of those greats and equally to be loved, for a film such as this comes once every 20 years. No
movie in recent years has quite made me feel
quite like a kid and taken me, for 3 hours, to a completely different world. People should genuinely give Dune 2 the chance it rightfully deserves and cherish this cinematic experience for it does not happen as often as we wish it would. Thank you Denis for making this possible.",positive
983,"Dune: Part Two is mesmerizing!! This is a sequel that we have been needing in the sci-fi genre for a long time now, and I would even say that now we have these two movies, it's fair to say that these are already way better than Star Wars. This movie delivered and exceeded all the expectations in visuals, story, music, epic story and acting. Dune: Part Two is the savior of sci-fi genre, and 100% one of the best films I have ever seen!Forget Disney Star Wars, this is a game changer! I have already seen the movie twice, and it truly gets better with every viewing. If anyone needs a good movie to watch, this is the movie they need. ;)",positive
984,"Villeneuve is at the top of his game here. Technically this is an absolute masterpiece. This is perfection in every way of filmmaking- really. I see elements and influences of Star Wars, Gladiator, Mad Max, Metropolis, and Triumph of the Will. The black and white scenes in this are pure excellence. Beautifully horrifying. The last Dune won six Oscars. Same crew this time. Some may not buy the chemistry between Chalamet and Zendaya and that's fair but the cast overall is a fantasy for many of us. Seeing Brolin, Walken, Chalamet, Bardem, Skarsgard share the screen with Pugh, Butler, Zendaya etc. EPIC. This film is timeless and will be a permanent top 50.",neutral
985,"Saw it yesterday. Not better than part 1. Part 1 gave enough time to establish all characters. Here few important thing or eventa are rushed. Also, Bgm is not great like part 1. Last 30 mintues were very rushed. Overall, a good movie but not better than part 1.Zendaya ,Timothee ,Florence, Rebecca, Austin, Walken,Bardem, Brolin all were good in their parts.Part 1 talked more with facial expressions, eyes of characters alongside backgroubd music. This one has his great scenes too, but 2nd half somehow lacks that perfection, for me.Cgi was also good. But that oscar worthy bgm was seriosly missing for me√∞≈∏Àú¬™",positive
986,"Dune: Part Two is a visually stunning and narratively gripping movie that continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in an impressive manner. The film's phenomenal visuals, score, VFX, and acting make the 166-minute runtime feel too little to enjoy fully. For the best experience, I highly recommend watching it in an IMAX theatre.Denis Villeneuve has done a fantastic job of taking the story from the book and transforming it into an epic second installment of his series. As someone who loved the first movie, I had high expectations, but Villeneuve managed to surpass them all. This movie proves that he is the sci-fi director of our generation!",positive
987,"Too easy to define it as impressive. For SFX, for acting, for fair and huge effort to adaptate a masterpiece.It is just a cathedral. It is memorable at whole defining the hard effort of a so ambitious director .But, I recognized, I am not one of its fans , not animated by enthusiasm, without ignore than I like it .A film proposing many gifts , great scene by scene, having the virtue to explore in pasionned manner the novel.Two good points for me - the white - gray of Harkonnen - indeed, not exactly the Harkonnen imagined by Herbert and the nice option for Emperor . I was seduced at whole by the work of Javier Bardem and I keep same question after the first part - is Timothee Chalamet the best option for Paul Atreides ? I do not know.It is not my favorit adaptation ( old and conservative, I remains prisoner of more modest Tv series of 2000 but I applaused and I appreciated this second delightful, imperial second part.",positive
988,"I've forgotten what happened in Dune: Part One. I'm not alone right? In fact I had to read my previous review to remind me, but with my no spoiler policy, I'm still a bit in the dark. I liked it though it seems and left looking forward to Part Two and so here we are. We start in the ashes of war, but the fight is not over. Paul Atreides (Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet) is lying in the sand dunes once more, fighting with those trying to destroy him, his family, both those fighting alongside and those yet to be born. I'd forgotten just how dense this is and it's really quite difficult to pick up. Watch Part 1 and 2 back to back if you can, there's no refreshers. The bad guys are The Harkonnen. Pasty bald fellas lead by Rabban (Dave Bautista). They now control the Spice fields. The stuff that sustains life on these alien planets and allows travel between them, although this all centres on one planet, Arrakis. Paul and Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) are in exile of sorts there, helped by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), they're on his turf, but the locals aren't happy about it, mainly because they hold him responsible for the death of one of their own, a detail I've clearly forgotten since the last film. There's a lot of chanting, contemplation, spirituality. It's packed with symbology and ritual. This will help the pair, while many don't like their presence, enough see them as a sign of hope. I'd forgotten too who Jessica is, the important detail is she's pregnant with Paul's baby sister. Making her his Mother, but honestly it takes me a while to clock this. She becomes embroiled in their new home's social and religious fabric, whilst Paul builds his myth as Stilgar's messiah. Chani (Zendaya) is having none of the mythical stuff, but she's happy to help him learn how to survive the desert. The visual juxtaposotion of the ancient desert and the sci-fi tech is arresting stuff. Add a layer of bwoarrrr sound design and it hits the blockbuster epic quota easily. It's not that a scene with gunfire and explosions is essential here, but it finally triggers a point, nearly an hour in where I finally feel onboard with this. Paul is shown to be what he is, a fighter, a politician, a leader. No longer living in the shadows of his past. He can move forward and so too can this film. For all the tender spiritual side, let's not forget what's central to all this. Spice. The commodity. The control of it. As Paul progresses with his new friends. Rabban is displeasing his boss the Baron (Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd) by letting things slip. It could do with a little more of this darkness as it builds. It's very slow paced. I've no issue with being patient but this does test it. As good as Chalamet is, this film puts more than it needs to on his shoulders. The first film seemed to balance all the political plot well with the action, tension and CGI eye candy. This though gets bogged down like Star Wars did with fluffy dialogue delivered by characters with hard to remember names. Honestly, I'm just not invested enough to care, even when the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his impressive family of Charlotte Rampling and Florence Pugh turn up, like inconsequential gods in a far removed subplot. The introduction of a new bad boy, Feyd-Raytheon (Austin Butler), who looks like a bald Erling Haaland, is one of the most stylishly cinematic things I've seen in a long time. It's pure style over substance and unoriginal in its gladiatorial aping, but it's still absolutely stunning. In short (a bit late for that), you've got the bad dudes inter-fighting, power grabbing, eventually getting themselves sorted in order to go up against the godlike purity of Paul and his mates, once they sort out their own religious clap-trap. Evil against the righteous. This sounds reductive, but that really is it. Feyd-Rautha adds a whole new story at the half way mark. It's almost like they got bored with Part Two and decided to start Part Three instead. It is all connected, but at three bloody hours, it's like a gruelling endurance test. Can anything save it? How about Josh Brolin with a sitar? He's Gurney Halleck, essentially the yahoo American composite. He carries it well, in fact all the acting is solid and you could take any single frame of your choosing and stick it on your wall as art. But there's no denying it's convoluted. You'll know this from Part One and if you've watched that, you'll watch this and you'll likely enjoy it. When it finally gets to its final act, it really is gripping. Do we need a Part Three? No not really, not in the same way we needed this. But it's coming all the same. I might need to watch Parts 1 and 2 again before watching it though, that's going to be a long 6 hours!",positive
989,"Every scene is a clip of its own and there is nothing connecting them.To break down the plot; fight scene, timothy and zendaya kiss scene, fighting some more, then some weird post apocaliptic bad guys rambling about spices, some more fight scene, another cgi scene, then repeat once more.Honestly after every scene I counted the minutes they wasted of my life. It is probably the worst film I've seen.I completely understand why it has such a high rating, you can have chalamet and zendaya in an instagram reel and make it to imdb top250 list apparently.I might have liked it if I was a member of the Gen-Z. Unfortunately, I'm not and I'm dragged to see this garbage by my wife who is Gen-Z.All in all, garbage movie, but I love spending time with my wife so I finished it :)",positive
990,Denis yet again understands cinema and understands the source material. His take on the story here elevates the source material in a way that can live alongside the book.Denis intentionally chooses what to focus the story on: Paul internal battle. A forced prophecy. A devotion to someone in the face of duty.The movie is clearly a spectacle and should be watched just on that. But the movie also is very upfront about its themes. More so than the book. And the appreciation to Denis on knowing what to change in the story to help elevate those themes.I read the book. And I have no qualms with the changes his made because it was all for the story.I applaud Denis.,neutral
991,"Dune: Part Two has been universally hailed as a sequel worthy of Terminator: Judgment Day, The Godfather Part II, and The Empire Strikes Back; a bonafide epic yielding additional comparisons to Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia; a picture that solidifies Denis Villeneuve as one of the modern titans of the art form. Even those who weren't so hot on the first film, finding its characters monotonous and its visuals largely dull, seem to have been thoroughly won over.And although I enjoyed the visuals and thought there was a purpose to their occasional drabness (imposing brutalist structures towering over nature), the new film indeed cranks the art direction up to eleven, exemplifying some of the most potent visuals in sci-fi history. Although I thought the characters worked fine in the original, in the sequel we're treated to powerhouse newcomers and darker depths to the figures we know -- when critics said ""I liked Dune: Part One just fine, but I just can't buy Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet as the hero"", readers of the Frank Herbert novel snickered (in Part Two, new fans will see why).If nothing else, they find that the whole thing feels more complete (recall that the first movie bamboozled many who hadn't a clue it was just ""Part One""). Frank Herbert's son, Brian, wrote ""When the new movie is combined with Dune: Part One it is by far the best film interpretation of Dune that has ever been done"".Other things that are expanded on and/or elevated include the performances of Zendaya (one of the most expressive and loveable actors of her generation, underused in the prior movie) as Chani, the young Fremen warrior who welcomed Paul Atreides into their camps after the fall of his ""House"", and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother who becomes the ""Reverend Mother"" of the Fremen, who believe she and Paul are instrumental to a prophecy of a mother and child sent to reclaim Planet Arrakis from oppression -- the Imperial spice-mining colonies that now belong to the vile Harkonnen family. On that note, we also get a better look at the Harkonnen homeworld, whose ""black sun"" seems to erase all color from it, bar the blackest of black and whitest of white.This moment is one of many reasons you need to see this in a theater. I cannot stress it enough. These sequences -- from the most thunderous battles and Sandworm rides to the intimate final duel that left my audience at the edge of their seats -- are paralyzing to behold in an auditorium, complete with music and sound design that seem to make the very Earth tremble (then falling dead silent at pivotal moments), all sublimely photographed by ""swirly bokeh"" extraordinaire Greig Fraser. (It's not often you see a film and just know you're witnessing the creation of ""iconic"" images.) The action scenes are elevated by impressive choreography and, of course, the performances.The most intense of the new faces is undoubtedly Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha (that's the Sting character in the 1984 movie, in case you needed the reference), lauded by many as the best villain performance since Anton Chigurh and Ledger's Joker. Additional newcomers include Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, L√É¬©a Seydoux as Lady Fenring of the ""Bene Gesseret"" priestesses, and Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.Returning actors include Javier Bardem as the Fremen leader Stilgar, whose incorrigible fanaticism gets some big laughs; Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, who is out for Harkonnen blood; Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd as the revolting Baron Harkonnen; Dave Bautista as The Beast Rabban, who envies the affection the Baron shows toward Feyd; and Charlotte Rampling as the Imperial Reverend Mother, who hatches schemes of her own. Certain characters I've mentioned are given just a few minutes of screen time, yet they all make a considerable impact, from the memorable line reads to the looks that speak even louder, most notably during that final exchange of haunting glances between Paul, Chani, and the Princess.At the center is Chalamet as Paul ""Muad'Dib"" Atreides -- a performance that will vindicate his stans and make non-believers hopefully realize not only how formidable he can be, but what he was truly going for in Part One. Chalamet is known for his thin frame and his friendly demeanor; yet, we have absolutely no trouble believing that his Paul would be a master of sparring and a conqueror of Sandworms. As I wrote earlier, those who judged the first movie by how well his story works as a garden-variety ""Hero's Journey"" are bound to have an ""oh"" moment or two.If you're still worried that some of these elements seem lifted from other works, recall that Dune is (likely) an older series than whatever you're thinking of. All the same, even the familiar images feel new here -- epic in scale in a way that cinema hasn't been able to achieve until now. This movie is a close-to-perfect marriage of hitherto unthinkable technology and a crystal-clear vision for said tech to realize. In part, the movie plays as if Villeneuve heard the complaints of the previous film and, as if on a dare, went all the way with his movie magic for the sequel, putting the doubters in their place.Knowing how the books go, I know this franchise is far from done. And despite how long this film was, I never wanted it to end and still crave more, ergo I'm more than stoked to see what Villeneuve does with the rest of Herbert's legendarium and if audiences keep finding resonance in his version of it. The world of Dune is a uniquely well-realized potential future: intimidatingly immense and outlandish on one hand, and dreadfully convincing on the other, showing that Imperialism and colonialism may be alive and well millennia ahead. (Had this film been made with even less studio interference, the parallels between the Fremens' plight and Palestine may have been even more obvious.)The story of Dune Messiah still needs to be adapted and I'm confident that, once Villeneuve shows it to us, the same media illiterates who started posting Film Twitter Takes about how Poor Things approves of misogyny once that film came out on digital won't be taking Paul's ""White Savior"" and Jessica's cultural appropriation at face value -- or so we may hope. An interesting theory from Walter Chaw suggests that the reason so many people keep failing to get the point of Dune -- and Paul Atreides specifically -- is that ""colonialism is so embedded in our value system as manifest destiny"" that it's straight-up impossible for some of us to interpret a figure like this as anything other than a good guy. Lisan al-Gaib, and all that.",positive
992,"I think there are so many things to talk about this movie so let's keep it ""simple"". This film is absolutely incredible, it's a masterpiece, a work of art. Besides that I think this is also one of the most important films ever made. It accomplishes so much on so many levels. For example, when was the last time we saw a science-fiction movie with masterclass acting, deep characters, perfect cinematography, immaculate sound design (the list could go on...) and that is adapted from a novel?! But more specifically, I believe this film showed us the true power of CGI and how to use it properly. It was nearly invisible and it blended perfectly with the rest of the footage. Denis Villeneuve just took us somewhere no one had ever been and it truly is an undescribable experience. He made a perfect use of wide shots, lenses and filters. Adding to that is the immaculate sound design. Hans Zimmer yet again makes an incredible original score and Villeneuve compliments it with the perfect background noises. One thing is for sure though, this is a movie to see in theatre. For me, this was the best theatre experience ever. So if you can go see it I highly recommend to go see it before it leaves to go into streaming.",positive
993,"I'll try keep this simple so...this is the exact type of movie you go to see on the big screen, just literal jaw drop-age. The scale of this feels so massive and makes you feel so tiny in so many scenes and it blew me away. The effects were so damn brilliant with some of the most stunning visuals you will ever be able to see from a movie. The acting by the entire cast was completely from the top shelf with a special shout-out to Austin Butler, his Feyd-Rautha was perfect and the score oooft, it had me tapping my foot at times. I also swear at some points I could smell the sand that's how immersed I was in this movie.After watching a couple more lower budget type Sci-fi movies lately that are slightly different Sci-fi genre like Synchronic and Freaks (which I enjoyed both a lot) to then go and watch Dune part 2 and just think yeahhhhh this is a whole other level. I think I saw the budget for the new Gladiator was 310 million and Dune part 2 was 190 million. For this to look just as unbelievably amazing as it did with that budget it makes me think what the hell will they do with Gladiator money?I've read the book and loved it, I've seen part 1 and 2 and loved them. Some scenes in part 2 in the movie were so much better than imagined from the book. Any Sci-fi lover that doesn't like this movie I'll be shocked. It's an absolute epic of the genre that I think will be hard to top anytime soon if at all. Everyone needs to see this on the big screen and lose yourself on the planet Dune.Denis Villeneuve has nailed this and might be my favourite creator in the industry at the moment with Nolan. Their tone and styles just extract the unreal I crave from cinema at the moment, hopefully a lot more to come.",positive
994,"It's a masterpiece, you need to watch it carefully, every scene, detailing and on screen depiction of every scene is great, outstanding special effects, comparable to that of Star Wars. There are one or two Oscars waiting for it. Better than Dune one. Keeps same expectations as Dark Knight, RRR and Mandalorian(Series). It is going to meet it. Watch it in IMAX if possible also in atmos sound system. In Hindi, I can say, ""Bawaal movie"". Acting is Okayish but Bgm, special effects and story is awesome. I have to write 97 more words to submit the review but that's it. Don't miss it. This is meant to be seen on big screens.",positive
995,"Everything about this movie is so good that it practically made me numb. I still can't even process it. I'm a huge fan of the novels, and in a few ways this movie manages to improve on the source material by giving us a very intimate rendition of this awesome story.It totally kicks ass on all fronts. Writing, visuals, sound design/music, and acting at its absolute highest levels on the grandest scale. Truly epic. One of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever made. No easy task either given the film's source material, but executed tastefully and dare I say, flawlessly utilizing minor alterations to create the best film it can be. Believe the hype. If you don't like this movie, then well, I guess epic sci-fi stories and deserts simply aren't your thing. Fair enough, but for most of us, it really doesn't get any better than this.The script is excellent. This was a very hard novel to adapt, and the writers have truly done a fantastic job with it. Changes have been made from the source material, details added, but essentially it captures the best themes of the book. Overall, each change, cut, or addition makes for a better movie, still remaining faithful to the films source material. I will admit however, that the Dune nerd in me would have liked to see that talking baby... but the way they did it was effective and probably better for the silver screen. Frank Herbert purist might get pretty bummed over this, but not I. The change works well, and I trust Denis Villeneuve with what he wanted to do in his telling.I want to point out that I was kind of surprised how terrific the acting in this film was considering the amount of vanity and celebrity the cast seems to bask in. This isn't just a cast of what Marilyn Manson would call ""the beautiful people"" but actually a talented one. Timothy Chalamet really brings it in the films second half. He was born to play Paul Atreides, and I would have never of known he was capable of pulling it off so well with what I have previously seen him in. I loved Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha, but it was actually Javier Bardem as Stilgar that I enjoyed the most. His character is beautifully written in this screenplay, providing smart laugh out loud comic relief but also delivering serious dramatic scenes with awesome dialogue. His delivery of ""I don't care if you do not believe, I believe..."" which was perfectly placed in the trailer is even better in the film. The man is a very good actor, obviously given his track record, and it was simply awesome seeing him deliver such well written dialogue.The visual fx... I don't even know how to convey how great they look. They, simply put, are stunning. What a treat to see it in IMAX. This movie truly was made for IMAX. It looks incredible.Which brings me to cinematography. Also stunning. Absolute perfection. The lighting and color pallets... my God, it's just stunning.Sound design and score are every bit as awesome as they were in the first film. Perfection. Hans Zimmer is really in the prime of his career, giving us stunningly original and memorable works of music.As far as memorable scenes and sequences go, every single one hits pretty hard and is expertly crafted. The climatic final knife fight was the best I had scene since the climatic sword fight in Rob Roy. But I can't write this gushing review without mentioning the sand-worm riding scene where Paul first mounts one of these iconic beast. WOW. This goes down as one of my favorite scenes ever in a film. I practically edged myself off my seat, even knowing what the outcome would be having read the book. It was just... wow, so cool.Upon the movie ending, my wife and I just wanted to stay in the theater and watch it over again. I can't wait to see this film again, and again, and again. I really think it is a modern classic. This isn't something I say lightly. The hype was real for me. I hope you all feel the same as I did, because both Dune and Dune: Part 2 are some of the greatest times I've had at the movies in the past twenty years. This is what large budget major studio films should be. This is art on its grandest scale, not just a cheap attempt to cash in on a beloved franchise. It's so refreshing and nice to see that Hollywood still has a few quality films to make. In my personal opinion, Timothy Chalamet and Zendaya earned every right to wear those ludicrous outfits on the red carpet. They could have worn hot dog suits for all I care, because not only did they do a fantastic job, but the entire cast and crew. This film helped create something people such as myself will be enjoying for a very, very long time.",positive
996,"Well, this one has a lot more flow in it than the first one. Still there are parts where people are left wondering why they are added, but are quite much less than what was in the first movie.The battles were more moving and more detailed. The story was more directed. Still there was bloat, but was more or less acceptable.The story was once again predictable and was easy to foresee the end of the movie. In details actually. Actually I am quite sure what will happen in the third movie without ever reading the books or watching the old version of the movie.The parts that made me laugh as they were ridiculous and just not logical (like the part where they run 100m in the sand to hid, while leaving a clear trail behind to be found) were scattered.Overall, enjoyable movie but doubt I will watch it again.",neutral
997,"A very very good movie.The story picks up basically right after the first movie, as the plot gets deeper and deeper throughout the movie I will give a general gist.Paul is battling the fact he is the prophecy while his mother goes above and beyond to prove it. Chani and Paul grow closer over his time becoming a Fremen as she vows to stick with him as he remains who he is.Beast is struggling with the Fremen attacks to stop the spice harvesting, his brother Feyd is brought in as he is a psychopath and they need someone crazy to eliminate the threat.The whole movie is a religious and power struggle battle. The north, and south in contrast while they all seek a leader, it's a very strong movie in that sense.The acting is top notch from EVERYONE!!! Timothee really has his movie, the second half he SHOWS his chops and wow, one of his strongest performances in my opinion.It's hard to pick out others as they are ALL so strong, his mother plays a vicious role superbly, Austin Butler is great as a crazed killer power hungry lunatic, all great.The score and visuals go without saying, Cinema experience needed for this one.I gave the first a lower score it wasn't for me, but this was great, 9/10.",positive
998,"I am quite disappointed with this movie, I'm even sure if it deserves a 6.I loved Dune: part one so much, amazing movie, the storytelling was on point, and despite the fact that it was super long, it never got boring.In this movie I feel like you could make it one hour long and not much will change. It was quite boring and of course, it ended on a cliffhanger.One of the worst things about it in my opinion was the fact that most of the actors didn't articulate well. I could not for the life of me tell you what the movie was about if i didn't watch it with subtitles. You could not understand ANYTHING of what they were saying.I feel like my opinion is quite uncommon, because all of the ratings i saw beforehand were praising the movie. Maybe that was the reason i was expecting for it to be spectacular. Because for me, not many movies deserve a 10 and i was just looking though these reviews, seeing 10,10,10,10..
Overall, I am pretty upset that i couldn't give it more than 7, it just doesn't deserve it.",positive
999,"What a strange pacing, the movie felt rush despite being 2h45.Many scenes are reminiscent of the first feature without adding anything to the story and/or the development of the characters arcs.The visuals are great, but it doesn't makes it for everything unfortunately, its structure has the same borrowing feeling of Campbell's hero's journey from Star Wars : A New Hope, being also +40 years late. (Despite having a better source material from the book, unfortunately not used that much efficiently)The sides are defined with a manichean style, the antagonists don't have any substance unfortunately, House Harkonnen is full of bad guys, the whole arc introducing Feyd-Rautha is honestly anecdotal.The movie also clearly lacks of stakes, due to a confusing editing style where the epic scenes are rushed down, making you feel like all the meaningful deaths were used in the first entrance, giving absolutely 0 thrilling moments despite once again, a truly achievement in terms of visuals and sound design, the two value added seeing it in theaters imo.Overral its hard to recommend a movie being so safe and dull, participating to the slowly decay of an industry that struggle to reinventing itself, counting only on franchising and uniforming formulas of mythical stories. Maybe the third installment will leave a better taste? We'll see.",positive
1000,"Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two is one of the best Sci-Fi Fantasy movies to be ever produced.The Adapted Screenplay is almost true to its source material. The
""spice"" of the book has been captured faithfully and even there are few deviations from the book, I choose to believe the same would have taken to adapt the movie in best possible manner.The soundtrack of the movie by the Han Zimmer elevates the mood and make each scene feel meaningful and epic. The sound design complements the visual prowess perfectly.Dennis Villeneue's Dune Trilogy will be his Magnus Opus. Each shot has been carefully crafted to almost perfection leaving no waste behind. We are truly blessed to witness his work.With an Ensemble cast of industry veterans and Hollywood's future biggest and brightest stars, the casting of new characters can be considered as great. Each actor/actress have done justice to their roles with standout performances by Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Timothee and Austin Butler.Production design, costumes and make-up is excellentA must watch for every movie-goer. Experience it in IMAX if possible.",positive
